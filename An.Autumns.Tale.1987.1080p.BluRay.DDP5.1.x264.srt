چرا بهت میگن دست نشانده؟
Why are you called Figurehead?

67
00:07:11,042 --> 00:07:13,167
بخاطر اینکه خشک و زشته
He's called that cause he's wooden and ugly

00:07:13,292 --> 00:07:15,375
خیلی پولداره
And money flows by him like water

Run by gas?

109
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,542

You'd better watch out

111
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,000

Women are chable'!

127
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:49,542
What'd you say? Chable?

128
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:55,500
Nuisance! Trouble!
Don't you understand English?

129
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,958
No one ever came to meet me
in my 10 years of sailing career

130
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:10,917
Vincent doesn't expect me here either

131
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,500
How long it's gonna take?

132
00:13:16,042 --> 00:13:17,042
15 minutes

133
00:13:18,917 --> 00:13:21,375
If you say 15, you mean 30

134
00:13:21,542 --> 00:13:22,792
I ain't wrong to take it for 60, e[i?

135
00:13:25,542 --> 00:13:28,667
How do I look? Give me a grade

136
00:13:30,792 --> 00:13:31,625
A plus

137
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:14,833
Wait for me

138
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,375
Hurry

139
00:14:17,917 --> 00:14:19,833
Peggy, what do you think of this game?

140
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,000
Well, I think the pitcher is the best

141
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:24,917
What about me?

142
00:14:39,417 --> 00:14:43,833
Jenny...!

143
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,917
Stop it.
This is embarrassing in front of people

144
00:14:47,792 --> 00:14:50,000
I don't care! Nobody knows me here

145
00:14:51,042 --> 00:14:53,500
Here are the clay dolls you asked me to make

146
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:55,667
Now don't act like a child

147
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,708
It took me two months to make them.
Don't you want them?

148
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,042
Now that you're here

149
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:04,958
Have you got a place to stay?

150
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,458
None of your business. What do you care?

151
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,708
When I came or when I will go

152
00:15:11,792 --> 00:15:12,667
Calm down!

153
00:15:13,417 --> 00:15:14,583
Over here girls are liberal-minded

154
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,417
It's just like saying 'Hi'

155
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:18,583
Saying Hi?

156
00:15:20,292 --> 00:15:21,333
That simple?

157
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:26,500
Well, what a party? Who is she?

158
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:30,375
Go ahead, tell heM

159
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:36,458
Peggy, this is Jennifer, from Hong Kong

160
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,750
Hi

161
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,792

166
00:16:22,792 --> 00:16:23,583
Leave me alone

167
00:16:23,667 --> 00:16:26,333
Might as well give him a good scolding

168
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:27,500
No...

169
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,292
She wont answer your call

170
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:39,917
Well, Silver Palace Restaurant then

171
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,042
He wants to see you tomorrow

172
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
No

173
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:51,875
Lost again yesterday, dammit

174
00:16:58,708 --> 00:16:59,542
Excuse me

175
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:01,667
So?

176
00:17:02,542 --> 00:17:04,583
Well, now that you're here

177
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,792
you should...

178
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:09,625
widen your horizon
and experience different lifestyles

179
00:17:10,792 --> 00:17:12,042
You mean get to know more girls?

180
00:17:12,792 --> 00:17:14,958
Don't be childish

181
00:17:15,792 --> 00:17:17,042
You should open up more

182
00:17:18,417 --> 00:17:21,000
It took me two years to save up...

183
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,750
enough money to come study with you

184
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:28,000
I've always encouraged you to further study

185
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:30,792
But, not necessarily with me

186
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:36,500
What's more,
I'm planning to transfer to Boston,

187
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:37,750
I'm leaving tomorrow

188
00:17:38,667 --> 00:17:39,833
With her?

189
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:42,500
Mind your feet!

190
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:45,583
I'll see

191
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:49,542
Tell me

192
00:17:52,292 --> 00:17:53,667
Do you prefer her to me?

193
00:17:56,417 --> 00:17:58,708
You shouldn't tag along all the time

194
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:00,583
It's no good for your growth

195
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,417
Don't talk like you're doing this for me

196
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,750
Just say you want to leave

197
00:18:07,667 --> 00:18:10,708
What should I say?
Remember what Woody Allen said?

198
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,875
A relationship is like a shark

199
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,500
It has to move constantly. Or it dies

200
00:18:17,042 --> 00:18:18,625
Did Allen Tam the singer say that?

201
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:19,292
He only said:

202
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,292
What a trap, and why me, why me

203
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:22,000
Bullshit

204
00:20:22,042 --> 00:20:24,000
Sis 13

205
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,833
Gas leak...!

206
00:20:32,917 --> 00:20:33,208
What's up?

207
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,458
Gas leak...!

208
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:38,750
Call the Fire Department!

209
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:39,625
Are you airight?

210
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:44,917
You airight? Sis 13?

211
00:20:45,042 --> 00:20:47,750
Fire Department? We got fire here

212
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:56,750
Get out the house. Where's the leak?

213
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:57,958
There

214
00:21:03,667 --> 00:21:06,333
Goddammit. Go! Go home!

215
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,375
Hello

216
00:21:52,667 --> 00:21:54,583
What's up?

217
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,708
I don't know. He hung up

218
00:21:58,667 --> 00:21:59,792
The phone didn't even ring

219
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:02,000
Really?

220
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:07,333
Wanna go for a walk?

221
00:22:18,542 --> 00:22:19,917
Figgy

222
00:22:20,042 --> 00:22:22,375
how about taking me to Boston?

223
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:26,667
No, you ain't going, dammit!

224
00:22:27,667 --> 00:22:29,625
You're here to study

225
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:34,667
Make good use of your time to learn

226
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:36,875
Forget about that jerk

227
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,958
He doesn't care for you

228
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:40,667
Who says he doesn't care for me?

229
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:43,958
It's obvious, come on

230
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:49,375
Look at yourself. You're mess

231
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:52,417
Crying your eyes out, tearing yourself apart

232
00:22:52,667 --> 00:22:54,792
You only make yourself cheap

233
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,958
Figgy, I'm already 23

234
00:23:00,417 --> 00:23:03,875
Fantastic,
the prime of your life I'm 33 already

235
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:07,458
A 23-year-old woman is

236
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:09,042
older than a 33-year-old-man

237
00:23:12,667 --> 00:23:13,958
Let's get back home

238
00:23:16,792 --> 00:23:20,750
Mammy, I've been here for a week now

239
00:23:20,958 --> 00:23:24,417
Figurehead has found me a nice apartment

240
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:28,667
Cosy and spacious

241
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,542
New York is beautiful

242
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:42,625
Vincent has been busy lately but...

243
00:23:44,042 --> 00:23:48,625
we're going to see a musical next week

244
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,667
The school's started

245
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:56,958
Don't worry about money, I have enough

246
00:23:57,875 --> 00:24:01,583
Don't send me anymore. Save it for yourself

247
00:24:49,792 --> 00:24:50,583
What do you want?

248
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:00,083
Egg sandwich

249
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:02,917
How many eggs?

250
00:25:04,667 --> 00:25:04,958
How much are they?

251
00:25:05,542 --> 00:25:07,708
$0.60 for 2 eggs, $0.50 for 1

252
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:09,542
1 egg

253
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:12,833
Sandwich, Single egg

254
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,375
Hey, Figgy

255
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,875
Hello, animals. How's it going on?

256
00:25:49,542 --> 00:25:52,917
Sis 13, see ya guys around

257
00:25:54,458 --> 00:25:57,833
What brought you here?
You do know your way around

258
00:25:58,917 --> 00:26:01,458
Single egg sandwich, goody!

259
00:26:02,458 --> 00:26:03,000
Hey, kid, come here

260
00:26:03,125 --> 00:26:04,625
What's up, Figgy?

261
00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:09,583
2 roast duck rice, extra duck.
What's soup of the day?

262
00:26:09,667 --> 00:26:11,000
Winter melon

263
00:26:11,125 --> 00:26:15,667
Get me 2, extra melon. No charge!

264
00:26:15,917 --> 00:26:17,417
Okay, anything you say

265
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,375
Quick

266
00:26:20,458 --> 00:26:21,667
Didn't see you a couple of days

267
00:26:21,875 --> 00:26:22,750
School just started

268
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:26,000
Good, Washington said,

269
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:27,875
'A good start is half way to success.'

270
00:26:28,542 --> 00:26:29,750
Did Washington say that?

271
00:26:30,333 --> 00:26:32,542
If not Washington then it must be Confucius.

272
00:26:32,667 --> 00:26:33,875
Either on&

273
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,000
Here, Figgy. Special for you

274
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:38,833
Yummy yummy

275
00:26:40,042 --> 00:26:43,458
Dig in. Can't study with an empty stomach

276
00:26:46,375 --> 00:26:50,500
A country is as good as its people
and its people as good as their food

277
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,792
Come on, dig in!

278
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:59,333
Let go yourself

279
00:26:59,625 --> 00:27:01,458
And enjoy

280
00:27:01,583 --> 00:27:02,750
You ain't got too many lives to live

281
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:10,042
Say, Figgy, where can I buy a bookshelf?

282
00:27:10,417 --> 00:27:14,833
Buy? I'll build one for you

283
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:18,458
Good, someday when you're free...

284
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,917
A real man doesn't say someday

285
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,708
He says today

286
00:27:22,833 --> 00:27:23,583
Let's go after this

287
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:38,750
Bath-tub, desk

288
00:27:43,917 --> 00:27:45,750
Too bad that window is blocked off...

289
00:27:45,875 --> 00:27:47,417
or we can see Brooklyn Bridge

290
00:28:01,958 --> 00:28:05,667
It took me 3 days to paint this window.

291
00:28:05,792 --> 00:28:06,875
You dig?

292
00:28:06,958 --> 00:28:09,333
I dig. Soda

293
00:28:09,417 --> 00:28:10,333
Good.

294
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:16,333
Study hard from now on

295
00:28:16,458 --> 00:28:17,833
Don't let people look down on you

296
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:21,500
What else can I do now that I'm here

297
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:27,417
Nice watch

298
00:28:27,542 --> 00:28:28,792
My grandpa gave it to me

299
00:28:28,917 --> 00:28:31,500
Only the watch band is too worn-out

300
00:28:31,583 --> 00:28:34,667
What a pity! Get another one

301
00:28:35,542 --> 00:28:37,958
I don't even have money for my tuition

302
00:28:38,542 --> 00:28:41,458
I found a part-time job, babysitter

303
00:28:41,542 --> 00:28:42,875
How much?

304
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,292
Enough for rent

305
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,333
I need another job...

306
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:49,833
for the rest

307
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,292
Then I can rest assured and really study

308
00:28:52,375 --> 00:28:53,792
Smart girl. Some ambition

309
00:28:55,625 --> 00:28:58,375
There might even be money left
for a Broadway show

310
00:28:59,667 --> 00:29:02,083
Yankee opera. They're disgusting

311
00:29:02,708 --> 00:29:07,583
Shall we dance...?

312
00:29:29,458 --> 00:29:30,458
Please line up, sir

313
00:29:30,542 --> 00:29:33,375
There are people like this

314
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:54,583
Sis 13

315
00:29:54,708 --> 00:29:57,583
Here comes your Broadway tickets

316
00:29:58,417 --> 00:29:59,375
What'd you say?

317
00:29:59,875 --> 00:30:01,000
It's for you

318
00:30:01,958 --> 00:30:03,667
Doing your own cooking

319
00:30:04,458 --> 00:30:07,333
Here your fried rice, not salty enough

320
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,750
Looks funny

321
00:30:10,583 --> 00:30:11,750
I'm in a hurry

322
00:30:12,458 --> 00:30:13,792
I start babysitting tonight.

323
00:30:13,875 --> 00:30:15,542
All the way out to Long Island.

324
00:30:15,667 --> 00:30:21,208
Nice area

325
00:30:21,292 --> 00:30:23,583
A girl likes you should be with a good family

326
00:30:23,667 --> 00:30:25,667
Ain't no good to be with scum like me

327
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,667
Going tonight?

328
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:28,292
Yeah, right now.

329
00:30:28,417 --> 00:30:29,833
What'd you say just now
about Yankee opera tickets?

330
00:30:29,917 --> 00:30:31,250
You got tickets for me?

331
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:34,083
Hell, Yankee opera is disgusting

332
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:35,708
It'll taste better...

333
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:37,792
if you think of it as fried cookies

334
00:30:37,875 --> 00:30:40,375
Close the door for me, please. Bye

335
00:31:28,958 --> 00:31:30,833
I ain't scalping ticket!
I ain't no yellow cow (scalper)

336
00:31:30,917 --> 00:31:33,500
You can't sell tickets out of here!

337
00:31:33,708 --> 00:31:36,042
I'm just waiting for my girlfriend!

338
00:31:36,167 --> 00:31:38,292
Whatever you say is right!
Whatever I say is wrong!

339
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:40,208
I don't understand what you are talking

340
00:31:40,333 --> 00:31:45,542
You talk all yes talk! I talk all no talk!

341
00:31:45,625 --> 00:31:46,750
Figgy -Right on Sis 13

342
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:48,833
This dumb cop doesn't even understand English!

343
00:31:48,958 --> 00:31:50,375
Tell him I ain't no yellow cow

344
00:31:50,458 --> 00:31:50,875
You know this guy?

345
00:31:50,958 --> 00:31:51,917
I don't understand you either

346
00:31:52,583 --> 00:31:53,417
Are you his friend?

347
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:58,542
Yes, these tickets, one for me and one for him

348
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,292
These are ours

349
00:32:00,417 --> 00:32:02,542
Airight! Just take off!

350
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,625
Understand? Not yellow cow

351
00:32:09,917 --> 00:32:13,625
Stupid cop! I ain't no scalper

352
00:32:13,792 --> 00:32:15,292
I ain't got nothing

353
00:32:15,375 --> 00:32:16,792
but I got my dignity

354
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:18,833
You bought those tickets for me?

355
00:32:19,708 --> 00:32:22,083
Of course not, they're Bull's

356
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:25,792
Ain't you gonna babysit?

357
00:32:26,667 --> 00:32:28,958
Oh no, I'm late

358
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:32,750
Where to? Let me drive you there

359
00:32:32,833 --> 00:32:34,417
That junk?

360
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,792
I'm too tired to hold the door on today!

361
00:32:36,917 --> 00:32:38,958
It's a new car

362
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:41,708
So this is your new car!

363
00:32:41,833 --> 00:32:44,792
You can hear every part except the horn

364
00:32:45,042 --> 00:32:47,500
I had a rough night,
stripped down to the last penny

365
00:32:47,875 --> 00:32:50,958
But this is a good convertible

366
00:32:51,042 --> 00:32:53,417
Same as Reagan's

367
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:57,792
Look at this hole. I'd better watch my feet

368
00:32:58,458 --> 00:33:00,000
Why don't you quit gambling?

369
00:33:00,667 --> 00:33:03,000
I need it to balance my mind

370
00:33:09,125 --> 00:33:11,000
Come on, we're gonna late!

371
00:33:11,125 --> 00:33:12,792
Let's wait for five more minutes, okay?

372
00:33:12,875 --> 00:33:14,792
We'll be late...

373
00:33:15,542 --> 00:33:17,708
Sorry, I have to run

374
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:19,458
I'll come after parking the car

375
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,583
You told her what time to come?

376
00:33:24,708 --> 00:33:26,542
Sorry, Mrs. Sherwood

377
00:33:26,625 --> 00:33:28,042
Didn't we say 6:30?

378
00:33:29,542 --> 00:33:30,500
Next time, I'll be...

379
00:33:30,583 --> 00:33:33,542
You'd better. Time is important to me

380
00:33:33,958 --> 00:33:36,292
I wait for you in the car

381
00:33:38,458 --> 00:33:39,958
My daughters in there,
go in and introduce yourself

382
00:33:40,083 --> 00:33:42,625
I have to rush for the show

383
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:45,500
Bye

384
00:33:54,625 --> 00:33:56,958
Why don't you go in?

385
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:58,208
Well? Get in...

386
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:03,292
Hi

387
00:34:07,708 --> 00:34:10,375
Figgy, come in and stay with me for a while

388
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,792
It's just a little girl

389
00:34:12,792 --> 00:34:15,292
Please

390
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:19,375
Women are chable'!

391
00:34:34,625 --> 00:34:38,417
Hi, Anna, have you eaten? -Yup

392
00:34:40,833 --> 00:34:43,500
Let me introduce
this big fellow here Uncle-Figgy

393
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:44,083
Hi

394
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:46,583
You're Piggy

395
00:34:46,958 --> 00:34:47,583
Right

396
00:34:48,792 --> 00:34:50,292
I want some grapes

397
00:34:50,458 --> 00:34:51,375
o kay

398
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,708
Aren't you going to peel them for me?

399
00:34:58,542 --> 00:35:00,333
Nobody peels grapes

400
00:35:00,458 --> 00:35:02,042
You just spit it out afterwards

401
00:35:02,458 --> 00:35:05,333
No. All my babysitters peeled them for me

402
00:35:06,542 --> 00:35:09,375
Shame on you

403
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,000
You're a big girl now, you know

404
00:35:12,417 --> 00:35:13,875
Watch me

405
00:35:13,958 --> 00:35:17,292
See how I eat melon seeds

406
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:26,583
You see!

407
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:30,583
You had the melon seeds
in there first Open your mouth

408
00:35:32,708 --> 00:35:34,542
You have bad breath

409
00:35:34,792 --> 00:35:35,875
And you have a big mouth

410
00:35:37,833 --> 00:35:43,333
If you don't behave, I'll beat you up

411
00:37:00,833 --> 00:37:03,417
Fuck it. Stripped clean again!

412
00:37:03,792 --> 00:37:05,875
Hurry up, how come?

413
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Wait!

414
00:37:08,667 --> 00:37:10,542
I got to quit gambling

415
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:12,417
Touch me $100

416
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:15,375
Got to quit

417
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,500
Got a cigarette?

418
00:37:18,958 --> 00:37:23,292
I want to start saving and open a restaurant

419
00:37:23,417 --> 00:37:26,833
Nuts! Money is to use, not to save

420
00:37:26,917 --> 00:37:28,500
I'll spend my last penny...

421
00:37:28,583 --> 00:37:31,042
on the day I croak

422
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,375
Hi, Figgy

423
00:37:42,792 --> 00:37:43,750
Snack for you

424
00:37:43,917 --> 00:37:46,958
Thanks. Did you remember Anna's mother?

425
00:37:47,875 --> 00:37:52,000
Sure, the one with 200 boyfriends

426
00:37:52,375 --> 00:37:55,333
One of her boyfriends, a dirty old man...

427
00:37:55,417 --> 00:37:56,917
wants to hire me
as a waitress in his restaurant

428
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:58,792
Oh, yeah?

429
00:37:59,083 --> 00:38:00,958
You'd better be careful

430
00:38:01,417 --> 00:38:02,958
I'll be fine

431
00:38:03,333 --> 00:38:04,625
You want me to check him out?

432
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:05,917
No need, really

433
00:38:06,583 --> 00:38:09,042
But come and see me at the restaurant

434
00:38:10,958 --> 00:38:12,667
Ain't got no time

435
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:14,708
Here, for you

436
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:19,542
How ugly! Who's this?

437
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,042
Guess

438
00:38:21,917 --> 00:38:23,292
Such an ugly face

439
00:38:25,458 --> 00:38:26,708
Must be me

440
00:38:26,833 --> 00:38:27,625
You're not so ugly

441
00:38:27,708 --> 00:38:29,542
If you shave,
your chin looks like Richard Geres

442
00:38:29,667 --> 00:38:30,583
Really?

443
00:38:31,333 --> 00:38:32,667
Yeah, it looks like his knee

444
00:39:31,542 --> 00:39:32,792
I was a student once

445
00:39:32,917 --> 00:39:34,417
Went through a IoU

446
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,750
Be a good girl and...

447
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:38,667
I'll raise your pay, okay?

448
00:39:39,583 --> 00:39:42,750
But you said you got no time

449
00:39:42,875 --> 00:39:44,625
I happened to pass by

450
00:39:44,875 --> 00:39:47,667
This is Tony, our manager. This is Figgy

451
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,500
This way

452
00:40:02,625 --> 00:40:04,833
That's the dirty old man

453
00:40:04,958 --> 00:40:07,542
I can see that

454
00:40:07,958 --> 00:40:10,375
Make yourself comfortable

455
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:18,417
What do you suggest?

456
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:22,875
How about fired rice?

457
00:40:30,667 --> 00:40:32,667
Sir, this is on the house

458
00:40:32,792 --> 00:40:33,792
What is this?

459
00:40:33,958 --> 00:40:35,458
Fin de Siecle

460
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:57,542
Thanks

461
00:40:58,917 --> 00:41:00,875
Sir, would you like to order now? -Sure

462
00:41:09,625 --> 00:41:12,375
Ill leave it up to you. Something simple
-Sure

463
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,000
Sir, how do you like these dishes?

464
00:41:26,792 --> 00:41:29,458
Good! Simple and good

465
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:44,708
Gee, its 6:35 p.m. already!

466
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,333
Thank you

467
00:42:19,542 --> 00:42:27,583
In the forest and meadow far far away

468
00:42:27,875 --> 00:42:36,583
My dear friend, what oh what is on your mind?

469
00:42:36,958 --> 00:42:40,958
While the birds are chirping happily...

470
00:42:41,708 --> 00:42:42,958
Mammys back!

471
00:42:47,708 --> 00:42:48,542
Anna

472
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,375
You're too early

473
00:42:50,458 --> 00:42:51,792
Mum's still at the beauty salon

474
00:42:51,958 --> 00:42:53,625
Can't I come in and wait?

475
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,500
Hello, Jenny

476
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:59,000
Can't I say hello to Jennifer?

477
00:42:59,792 --> 00:43:02,333
Don't kiss me. Your beard hurts me

478
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:06,292
Let's go out to the garden -Okay

479
00:43:07,375 --> 00:43:08,542
Make yourself at home

480
00:43:12,333 --> 00:43:16,000
Anna, wait there

481
00:43:18,625 --> 00:43:19,000
Hello

482
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:27,333
Such a lovely little girl. Fair and pretty

483
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,000
Just like you

484
00:43:29,875 --> 00:43:31,792
You're not feeling well?

485
00:43:32,625 --> 00:43:35,042
I might feel better
if you take your hand off me

486
00:43:49,625 --> 00:43:50,833
You have a sharp tongue

487
00:43:50,917 --> 00:43:54,375
Let's have coffee some time
and have a nice chat

488
00:43:54,458 --> 00:43:57,000
I'll pick you up tomorrow after school, okay?

489
00:43:57,792 --> 00:43:59,792
You don't have to hold my hand...

490
00:43:59,875 --> 00:44:01,750
to invite me for coffee

491
00:44:02,375 --> 00:44:03,875
Come on, I'm not that kind of man

492
00:44:03,958 --> 00:44:05,542
Have you been to Lincoln Centre?

493
00:44:05,833 --> 00:44:07,542
Here comes Mammy

494
00:44:08,625 --> 00:44:09,625
Mammy

495
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:11,333
Mammy

496
00:44:11,417 --> 00:44:12,375
Anna, have you been a good girl today?

497
00:44:12,458 --> 00:44:13,875
Yeah, I've been very good today

498
00:44:13,958 --> 00:44:18,542
Peter did a good job on your hair today!

499
00:44:18,833 --> 00:44:20,583
Jennifer, come here for a second

500
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:30,667
What's it?

501
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:36,708
Well, Anna's big now

502
00:44:36,958 --> 00:44:40,000
I'm thinking of sending her...

503
00:44:40,667 --> 00:44:42,333
to boarding school

504
00:44:44,458 --> 00:44:45,458
After she's gone...

505
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,458
there'll be nothing much to do here

506
00:44:50,625 --> 00:44:51,500
I understand

507
00:44:52,708 --> 00:44:55,958
Then well start tomorrow, okay?

508
00:44:56,542 --> 00:44:58,625
Still, I'll pay you for this week

509
00:44:58,708 --> 00:45:00,583
It's not necessary. I'm leaving now

510
00:45:03,792 --> 00:45:04,917
Jenny, where are you going?

511
00:45:08,458 --> 00:45:09,583
Mammy, where's she going?

512
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:13,042
Jenny said you were a bad girl,
she won't look after you

513
00:45:13,542 --> 00:45:15,750
You're lying. I was very good

514
00:45:15,875 --> 00:45:17,292
Jenny was bad, then

515
00:45:17,375 --> 00:45:19,958
Jenny was good too. Jenny...

516
00:45:20,958 --> 00:45:23,833
What's going on? Who's bad?

517
00:45:24,708 --> 00:45:25,500
You!

518
00:45:26,375 --> 00:45:27,500
What do you mean?

519
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:28,750
Forget it

520
00:45:30,542 --> 00:45:32,083
Wherere we going tonight?

521
00:45:38,458 --> 00:45:40,958
I was really enjoy the Chinese food

522
00:45:41,083 --> 00:45:42,875
Thank you very much

523
00:45:42,958 --> 00:45:44,583
Great. Thank you

524
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,417
Please come again

525
00:45:48,542 --> 00:45:49,875
I'd love to. I'll do it soon

526
00:45:49,958 --> 00:45:50,958
Thank you. Bye

527
00:45:52,292 --> 00:45:54,417
That's the dirty old man who blew Sis 13's job

528
00:45:56,292 --> 00:45:57,875
Sonovabitch! Take this

529
00:46:02,917 --> 00:46:06,333
And this And this! Now go to hell!

530
00:46:11,667 --> 00:46:14,875
You dirty old man

531
00:46:16,792 --> 00:46:19,375
You go to hell!

532
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,042
You go straight to hell!

533
00:46:22,583 --> 00:46:26,583
Stop it! Stop it...

534
00:46:26,667 --> 00:46:29,625
Fucking bastard!

535
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:31,417
Figgy, stop it!

536
00:46:33,167 --> 00:46:34,750
Now what have I done?

537
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,708
It was no big deal

538
00:46:36,833 --> 00:46:38,917
Don't get smart now

539
00:46:39,042 --> 00:46:40,042
Are you airight?

540
00:46:41,042 --> 00:46:42,417
Pick up the board

541
00:46:44,833 --> 00:46:47,667
Don't bother! Please go!

542
00:46:48,375 --> 00:46:48,917
What do you mean?

543
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:52,250
Well, you need not come back to work

544
00:46:52,333 --> 00:46:53,667
Goddammit!

545
00:46:53,792 --> 00:46:55,500
It's okay, Figgy!

546
00:46:56,792 --> 00:46:58,333
Okay. Where's my pay?

547
00:46:58,458 --> 00:46:59,333
What?

548
00:46:59,458 --> 00:47:01,750
Give it to her, dammit

549
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:08,875
Okay, you win!

550
00:47:12,833 --> 00:47:14,375
Let's split

551
00:47:21,375 --> 00:47:22,750
I'm okay. Let's go

552
00:48:19,875 --> 00:48:20,625
Hello

553
00:48:20,708 --> 00:48:22,875
It's me, Jennifer

554
00:48:22,958 --> 00:48:24,792
Anna, why haven't you gone to bed?

555
00:48:24,917 --> 00:48:28,000
I can't sleep. There's a ghost in the house

556
00:48:28,125 --> 00:48:29,917
Nonsense! Where's mammy?

557
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,833
She had a big fight with Uncle Tony
and she went out

558
00:48:33,917 --> 00:48:35,917
Jenny, I'm scared

559
00:48:36,042 --> 00:48:37,958
Silly girl. Go to bed now

560
00:48:38,083 --> 00:48:41,042
Jenny, please sing me a song

561
00:48:42,708 --> 00:48:43,583
Airight!

562
00:48:46,375 --> 00:48:52,667
In the forest and meadow far far away

563
00:48:52,792 --> 00:48:58,958
My dear friend, what oh what is on your mind?

564
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:05,750
While the birds are chirping
and dancing happily

565
00:49:05,875 --> 00:49:12,333
My dear friend, what oh what is on your mind?

566
00:49:13,333 --> 00:49:20,292
In the forest and meadow far far away

567
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:27,458
My dear friend, what oh what is on your mind?

568
00:49:27,958 --> 00:49:34,500
While the birds are chirping
and dancing happily

569
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:41,500
My dear friend, what oh what is on your mind?

570
00:49:48,917 --> 00:49:51,458
Where there is will, there is way

571
00:49:51,583 --> 00:49:54,958
See, your clay dolls can keep you alive

572
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:00,792
All yours!

573
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:04,208
Let's go eat pizza

574
00:50:04,333 --> 00:50:05,042
Okay

575
00:50:06,917 --> 00:50:08,917
Yankee pancake

576
00:50:09,042 --> 00:50:10,792
Disgusting

577
00:50:14,333 --> 00:50:17,833
Wait. Wait, let me take a look!

578
00:50:18,708 --> 00:50:19,375
Hello

579
00:50:20,833 --> 00:50:22,333
May I help you?

580
00:50:22,458 --> 00:50:23,417
May I have a look of this?

581
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,417
Sure

582
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:31,458
Take this for me, please.

583
00:50:40,042 --> 00:50:41,083
Gorgeous

584
00:50:43,083 --> 00:50:44,667
Matches my watch perfectly.

585
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:48,375
Right. Why don't you buy it?

586
00:50:49,333 --> 00:50:50,875
Let's see how much it is

587
00:50:56,833 --> 00:50:58,833
No, thanks!

588
00:50:58,958 --> 00:51:00,333
It's airight

589
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:02,292
Bye

590
00:51:02,417 --> 00:51:03,458
Bye

591
00:51:04,875 --> 00:51:08,792
How can a watchband be so expensive?

592
00:51:23,833 --> 00:51:26,375
Yankee tune, no different from Chinese music

593
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:30,542
Sounds like a Chinese funeral march

594
00:51:52,458 --> 00:51:53,750
Let's go, Figgy

595
00:51:53,833 --> 00:51:55,375
Why should we?

596
00:52:05,458 --> 00:52:08,875
I don't want to see him. Let's go!

597
00:52:16,667 --> 00:52:19,667
Figgy, how do I look today? What grade?

598
00:52:20,542 --> 00:52:21,500
D minus

599
00:52:22,417 --> 00:52:23,792
Be serious

600
00:52:23,875 --> 00:52:26,000
How do I compare with her?

601
00:52:26,458 --> 00:52:27,875
Who's her?

602
00:52:28,042 --> 00:52:30,417
You know, her

603
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:31,833
The one with Vincent

604
00:52:31,917 --> 00:52:33,292
Which one of us looks better?

605
00:52:33,417 --> 00:52:35,750
How should I know? Go ask Vincent!

606
00:52:37,458 --> 00:52:39,875
Why are you so touchy?
I know I'm not as pretty

607
00:52:40,625 --> 00:52:42,625
Always worrying about looks!

608
00:52:42,792 --> 00:52:44,667
It ain't everything!

609
00:52:46,083 --> 00:52:47,583
It is to Vincent

610
00:52:47,708 --> 00:52:49,500
He prefers her because she's pretty

611
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:52,000
What do you care?

612
00:52:52,083 --> 00:52:55,000
You dumped him! You dumped the past!

613
00:52:55,875 --> 00:52:57,000
Look at your cross face

614
00:52:57,083 --> 00:52:58,792
You're the ugliest on this street!

615
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:01,292
You don't have to be so mean...

616
00:53:01,375 --> 00:53:02,917
when I'm sad

617
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,542
Sad? Because you ain't pretty?

618
00:53:04,667 --> 00:53:07,667
How about me then? Should I kill myself?

619
00:53:08,417 --> 00:53:11,667
Your mum really spoiled you rotten

620
00:53:12,042 --> 00:53:13,500
What about you?

621
00:53:13,583 --> 00:53:15,958
Gambling 24 hours a day

622
00:53:16,083 --> 00:53:18,458
Pot calling the kettle black!
Who the hell are you anyway?

623
00:53:20,458 --> 00:53:22,542
Okay! I ain't nobody

624
00:53:22,625 --> 00:53:24,250
I ain't gonna bother you no more!

625
00:53:24,375 --> 00:53:25,542
You ain't 'chable' me no more!

626
00:53:25,625 --> 00:53:26,750
I ain't got nothing...

627
00:53:27,708 --> 00:53:29,417
but I got my dignity

628
00:53:58,542 --> 00:54:00,625
Here I win again!

629
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:04,250
Figgy

630
00:54:05,083 --> 00:54:05,917
Here, for Iuck

631
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:08,625
Figgy, spare me $2,000

632
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:10,000
What for?

633
00:54:10,083 --> 00:54:12,583
Just give it to me

634
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:15,542
What you need it for?

635
00:54:16,208 --> 00:54:18,542
Forget it

636
00:54:21,667 --> 00:54:22,833
What is it?
Aren't you opening your own restaurant?

637
00:54:22,917 --> 00:54:24,125
Right! And for that restaurant

638
00:54:25,042 --> 00:54:26,792
What's the matter?

639
00:54:26,875 --> 00:54:29,583
I pay the gangs $400 a week

640
00:54:29,667 --> 00:54:31,292
Still not enough

641
00:54:31,375 --> 00:54:33,042
Last week I was tight and...

642
00:54:33,167 --> 00:54:37,708
they smashed my front window yesterday

643
00:54:38,667 --> 00:54:40,042
Fuck it!

644
00:54:40,125 --> 00:54:42,167
We'll get them or my name is not Figgy!

645
00:54:42,292 --> 00:54:45,083
Wait! Where you gonna find those assholes
at this hour?

646
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,000
Forget it, Figgy

647
00:54:49,083 --> 00:54:50,750
If I can help it...

648
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,375
I ain't want to fight & hurt my business

649
00:54:53,458 --> 00:54:55,167
They'd be better not...

650
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,542
mess with us again!

651
00:54:58,625 --> 00:55:00,042
If they do you let me know...

652
00:55:00,167 --> 00:55:02,792
and I'll smash them!

653
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:03,833
Got ya

654
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:11,625
One and four

655
00:55:12,083 --> 00:55:13,917
Threes the winner!

656
00:55:16,667 --> 00:55:20,083
No money, no worry. Lets split!

657
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:58,750
(Dinner Time)

658
00:56:21,042 --> 00:56:22,917
Come in. Dinner's ready

659
00:56:23,875 --> 00:56:25,167
Try my cooking

660
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:35,000
Have some fish soup. I made it

661
00:56:42,458 --> 00:56:44,083
It's awful!

662
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:45,167
Really?

663
00:56:45,292 --> 00:56:51,458
To make fish soup, you must add orange peel!

664
00:56:54,708 --> 00:57:01,875
Also, you should use ripe potatoes

665
00:57:02,708 --> 00:57:05,500
And you mustn't put in salt too early

666
00:57:05,583 --> 00:57:07,583
Or the fish wouldn't be tender

667
00:57:10,667 --> 00:57:12,000
Did you use refined salt?

668
00:57:12,125 --> 00:57:12,708
Yes

669
00:57:12,833 --> 00:57:17,583
Big mistake! You must use natural salt

670
00:57:17,667 --> 00:57:22,917
And you mustn't stand too far or too close

671
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,125
You must be two feet away from the pot

672
00:57:27,292 --> 00:57:27,833
2 feet

673
00:57:27,958 --> 00:57:28,667
2 feet?

674
00:57:28,792 --> 00:57:30,167
Right. You don't understand?

675
00:57:30,292 --> 00:57:33,958
Okay. Let me tell you

676
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:37,083
Sit down and listen

677
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:42,542
If you're too far, it'll be too bland

678
00:57:43,833 --> 00:57:46,167
If too close, it'll be too salty

679
00:57:46,542 --> 00:57:47,542
I see!

680
00:57:48,083 --> 00:57:48,708
Good. Go ahead

681
00:58:28,708 --> 00:58:29,958
It will be a fine day tomorrow

682
00:58:30,667 --> 00:58:33,000
How do you know? Your rheumatism doesn't hurt?

683
00:58:33,125 --> 00:58:35,000
In October...

684
00:58:35,083 --> 00:58:40,167
if the evening wind is southerly...

685
00:58:41,833 --> 00:58:43,083
the following day will be a fine day

686
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,833
Really? No bullshit?

687
00:58:46,208 --> 00:58:48,500
The observatory may be wrong...

688
00:58:48,625 --> 00:58:50,250
but a sailor is always right

689
00:58:50,333 --> 00:58:52,625
And when there's lightning,
watch where it comes from

690
00:58:52,708 --> 00:58:56,083
East means rain; south means wind

691
00:58:56,167 --> 00:59:00,083
West means sunshine; north means gust

692
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,583
That's what you learned
during those sailing years?

693
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,042
What else was there to do?

694
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:08,542
All you saw everyday was the sea
and a couple of seagulls

695
00:59:09,667 --> 00:59:13,167
I heard that every seagull

696
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:15,500
is the soul of a dead sailor...

697
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:18,667
returning to his homeland

698
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:21,042
to see his friends

699
00:59:21,792 --> 00:59:23,583
See those fishing over there!

700
00:59:23,667 --> 00:59:25,500
They'reyour sailor friends

701
00:59:25,667 --> 00:59:28,042
Get out of here!

702
00:59:28,167 --> 00:59:29,958
Even if I were dead,
I wouldn't want to be a seagull

703
00:59:30,083 --> 00:59:31,792
Flying all day long is tiring

704
00:59:31,917 --> 00:59:34,042
When I'm dead, I want to just lie there

705
00:59:35,042 --> 00:59:36,208
Flying is great!

706
00:59:36,625 --> 00:59:38,083
I want to see more places

707
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:40,583
Once I was afraid to travel...

708
00:59:40,833 --> 00:59:42,208
but not anymore

709
00:59:42,542 --> 00:59:46,208
I want to see the world. Don't you?

710
00:59:48,958 --> 00:59:51,875
I've been everywhere in the world

711
00:59:51,958 --> 00:59:53,208
I don't want to go anywhere anymore

712
00:59:54,667 --> 00:59:55,750
What do you want then?

713
00:59:57,625 --> 01:00:02,000
I want to open a restaurant someday right here

714
01:00:02,208 --> 01:00:03,833
Facing the Atlantic Ocean

715
01:00:04,083 --> 01:00:05,583
Every night after work...

716
01:00:05,667 --> 01:00:06,500
I can sit by the door...

717
01:00:06,583 --> 01:00:08,958
enjoy the breeze, drink some beer...

718
01:00:09,083 --> 01:00:10,542
And gamble?

719
01:00:10,625 --> 01:00:14,542
No. No need to balance my mind
if I'm my own boss

720
01:00:15,208 --> 01:00:16,667
Not even if your friends invite you?

721
01:00:16,792 --> 01:00:17,792
No more gambling

722
01:00:20,458 --> 01:00:24,500
And by then my friends will all be gone

723
01:00:27,042 --> 01:00:30,583
Maybe...you'll be gone too

724
01:00:35,125 --> 01:00:36,500
Maybe I'll still be here

725
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,625
Then we can. ..watch the sea together

726
01:00:46,208 --> 01:00:48,167
What will you call your restaurant?

727
01:00:50,583 --> 01:00:52,250
You got suggestions?

728
01:00:53,125 --> 01:00:54,458
Let me think...

729
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:57,042
Didn't your teacher give you an English name?

730
01:00:57,125 --> 01:01:00,125
Yeah. Samuel, Samuel Pang

731
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:02,750
Call it Sampan, then

732
01:01:02,833 --> 01:01:05,000
Sampan? The boat?

733
01:01:05,083 --> 01:01:06,750
Right you are

734
01:01:06,833 --> 01:01:09,542
Sampan.. Sounds good

735
01:01:09,625 --> 01:01:11,000
Welcome to Sampan

736
01:01:11,083 --> 01:01:13,542
Table for two? Just a minute, please

737
01:02:12,375 --> 01:02:13,667
Thank you

738
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:27,000
The ride was real fun

739
01:02:27,083 --> 01:02:30,917
Yeah. Lets go again when we have money

740
01:02:32,917 --> 01:02:34,208
Want some?

741
01:02:47,208 --> 01:02:49,125
Let me sing you a song

742
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:57,000
In the forest and meadow far far away

743
01:02:57,333 --> 01:03:02,167
My dear friend, what oh what is on your mind?

744
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:06,625
While Sampan is chirping and dancing happily

745
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:13,500
My dear Chable'. . . is that how it goes?

746
01:03:14,792 --> 01:03:16,542
You know this song too?

747
01:03:22,167 --> 01:03:23,167
I overheard you

748
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,625
I'm going downstairs

749
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:43,500
If you need me for anything stamp on the floor

750
01:03:44,125 --> 01:03:49,542
Okay? I'm going.. I'm going

751
01:04:01,042 --> 01:04:02,208
Stamp on the floor!

752
01:04:49,167 --> 01:04:52,750
3 Commandments : Quit gambling,
quit drinking and quit smoking

753
01:04:52,833 --> 01:04:56,000
5 Goals : Diligence is the key to success

754
01:04:56,083 --> 01:04:57,958
Get the Green Card, then the Gold Card!

755
01:04:58,042 --> 01:05:00,667
Wear shoes, wear socks;
speak grammatical English

756
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:03,917
If you want it, go for it
Sampan wants Chable, Sampan goes for C[iable

757
01:05:13,958 --> 01:05:18,583
Someone wants Chable

758
01:05:22,833 --> 01:05:27,125
Fatty: Since coming to America,
everything has changed

759
01:05:27,667 --> 01:05:29,208
Do you remember the Figurehead?

760
01:05:29,958 --> 01:05:32,208
I think he's in love with me

761
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,125
I feel free when I'm with him

762
01:05:36,542 --> 01:05:40,917
Yet somehow there's a kind of man...

763
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,625
who's fun to be with,
but marriage is something else

764
01:05:45,375 --> 01:05:47,750
We belong to two different worlds

765
01:05:47,958 --> 01:05:51,250
If we should part someday

766
01:05:51,792 --> 01:05:53,667
I don't think either of us could take it

767
01:05:54,667 --> 01:05:56,083
He's over 30...

768
01:05:56,542 --> 01:05:58,000
and this looks like his first love

769
01:05:58,208 --> 01:06:02,708
I had a hard time getting over Vincent

770
01:06:02,833 --> 01:06:06,917
You know.. .a relationship is exhausting

771
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,417
Red is good, goddammit!

772
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:13,917
Red is romantic

773
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:14,958
You know shit about colouM

774
01:06:15,042 --> 01:06:16,958
White is pure

775
01:06:17,042 --> 01:06:17,958
White? Yeech! I say red!

776
01:06:18,083 --> 01:06:21,167
I say white! Shut up!

777
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:23,083
Now what should I choose : red or white?

778
01:06:23,167 --> 01:06:25,625
Okay. Quick -What's up?

779
01:06:26,708 --> 01:06:32,167
Nothing, just cleaning up the yard

780
01:06:32,583 --> 01:06:35,125
Oh, we're having a party here next week

781
01:06:35,250 --> 01:06:36,208
You'll be free?

782
01:06:37,458 --> 01:06:39,542
A party? Of course

783
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,167
Invite your friends too

784
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:44,625
All of them

785
01:06:45,583 --> 01:06:47,083
Great! I'll do it now

786
01:06:50,083 --> 01:06:51,625
What's the occasion?

787
01:06:51,875 --> 01:06:56,042
Do you need a reason to have fun?

788
01:06:59,583 --> 01:07:03,208
Why didn't you tell her it's your birthday?

789
01:07:04,083 --> 01:07:05,667
Why tell her, as long as I'm happy

790
01:07:05,792 --> 01:07:07,208
Well, it's your birthday

791
01:07:11,125 --> 01:07:12,708
You 'urn luen' her

792
01:07:13,125 --> 01:07:14,917
What's that? You jerk!

793
01:07:16,208 --> 01:07:18,583
He says that you have a crush on her

794
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:22,333
I know I'm right. You 'urn luen' her!

795
01:07:22,417 --> 01:07:24,750
You're crazy! Now move your ass and work

796
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:27,708
You guys are coming to the party too, right?

797
01:07:27,792 --> 01:07:29,167
Look. I'll help you decorate...

798
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:31,208
but I ain't coming to the party

799
01:07:31,542 --> 01:07:32,667
Come on. I'm inviting you guys!

800
01:07:32,792 --> 01:07:35,500
Me neither

801
01:07:35,625 --> 01:07:38,417
I'd rather have my hands on the cards

802
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:39,792
Ain't we friends?

803
01:07:39,875 --> 01:07:40,958
Forget it!

804
01:07:55,625 --> 01:08:02,625
Step aside! Hot water!

805
01:08:12,958 --> 01:08:15,250
Hello. Please come in

806
01:08:15,333 --> 01:08:17,167
Hi, Jenny

807
01:08:17,292 --> 01:08:18,167
Welcome you

808
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:19,542
Hi, Jenny

809
01:08:19,667 --> 01:08:21,292
Hi

810
01:08:22,167 --> 01:08:23,625
How are you?

811
01:08:29,667 --> 01:08:31,458
Whose chicken?

812
01:08:31,542 --> 01:08:33,417
Let me...

813
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:35,250
Sure! Here you go!

814
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:39,792
Why do you so late?

815
01:08:39,917 --> 01:08:41,583
Excuse me. Can I have a steak?

816
01:08:41,667 --> 01:08:43,042
Sure! Medium rare. Okay?

817
01:08:43,917 --> 01:08:44,917
Thank you

818
01:08:45,042 --> 01:08:47,125
Please get me that one -Wait a minute

819
01:08:47,250 --> 01:08:48,542
Jennifer, you're in another world

820
01:08:48,667 --> 01:08:50,542
She's thinking of her boyfriend

821
01:08:50,625 --> 01:08:51,542
Excuse me

822
01:08:54,458 --> 01:08:55,750
Figgy, lets dance

823
01:08:57,833 --> 01:08:58,958
Dance with your classmates

824
01:08:59,667 --> 01:09:00,917
Come on

825
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,125
Some other day

826
01:09:02,833 --> 01:09:04,417
A real man doesn't say someday

827
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:06,917
He says today

828
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:07,667
I guess you're right

829
01:09:07,792 --> 01:09:09,833
Jenny, let's dance

830
01:09:10,417 --> 01:09:11,583
Come on

831
01:09:12,458 --> 01:09:14,792
The next one, maybe

832
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:15,792
Come on

833
01:09:17,083 --> 01:09:18,000
The next one. Promis&

834
01:09:18,542 --> 01:09:19,583
The next one

835
01:09:34,292 --> 01:09:34,958
Do you like the food?

836
01:09:35,042 --> 01:09:36,708
It's great. Jenny

837
01:09:36,833 --> 01:09:38,375
Really, thanks a lot!

838
01:09:39,042 --> 01:09:40,500
Can I have a little rib?

839
01:09:42,667 --> 01:09:43,458
Thanks!

840
01:10:26,667 --> 01:10:27,958
How did you...
-I heard you...

841
01:10:33,042 --> 01:10:35,958
I heard you're throwing a party
so I came to see you

842
01:10:41,292 --> 01:10:43,500
Help yourself to the food, I made them

843
01:10:48,833 --> 01:10:50,583
Try the fish soup

844
01:10:50,667 --> 01:10:53,542
So you learned how to cook

845
01:10:54,417 --> 01:10:58,833
Well, mom is not around

846
01:11:14,667 --> 01:11:20,792
You remember the Portuguese restaurant
that makes very good seafood soup?

847
01:11:21,625 --> 01:11:24,375
And has a chunky Philipino singing...

848
01:11:24,583 --> 01:11:28,375
Three coins in a Fountain...

849
01:11:28,458 --> 01:11:30,750
Yeah, he has a strange voice

850
01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:35,708
Right... Each one seeking happiness...

851
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:09,708
How've you been?

852
01:12:12,042 --> 01:12:15,333
I broke up with Peggy

853
01:12:35,292 --> 01:12:36,500
How about you?

854
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,542
You.. .have a new boyfriend?

855
01:12:42,792 --> 01:12:43,917
I don't know

856
01:12:48,750 --> 01:12:50,417
I know who he is

857
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:11,000
$600! All of it!

858
01:13:14,458 --> 01:13:16,958
Didn't you say you're having a party?

859
01:13:17,583 --> 01:13:21,000
It's over

860
01:13:21,125 --> 01:13:22,958
Nineteen! Takes all!

861
01:13:23,083 --> 01:13:24,833
Game over

862
01:13:28,875 --> 01:13:32,625
All cleaned out! No money, no worry!

863
01:13:40,042 --> 01:13:40,958
Figgy

864
01:13:41,042 --> 01:13:41,875
What's up?

865
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,958
Figgy, spare me another $2,000

866
01:13:44,417 --> 01:13:47,125
What? Those assholes again?

867
01:13:47,208 --> 01:13:49,292
Bull, don't be afraid!

868
01:13:49,375 --> 01:13:50,958
It's the second time already!

869
01:13:51,042 --> 01:13:52,833
Who the fucks are these guys?

870
01:13:52,958 --> 01:13:55,042
Shut up All of you

871
01:13:55,167 --> 01:13:58,458
Let's just go and smash them! Move!

872
01:13:58,542 --> 01:14:01,708
Now let's go get my car

873
01:14:01,833 --> 01:14:04,542
Figgy, I don't want to fight...

874
01:14:04,625 --> 01:14:06,792
Let's go!

875
01:14:06,917 --> 01:14:08,917
Open the door!

876
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,333
Quick! Open the goddamn door!

877
01:14:11,458 --> 01:14:12,333
Piggy, wait...

878
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,542
Open up!

879
01:14:25,375 --> 01:14:26,083
Bye, Jenny

880
01:14:26,208 --> 01:14:28,417
Guys, have great fun. See you later

881
01:14:28,542 --> 01:14:29,625
See you

882
01:14:53,083 --> 01:14:55,708
Figgy, where've you been?

883
01:14:57,333 --> 01:15:01,000
I was bored! I was unhappy!

884
01:15:02,250 --> 01:15:04,375
It's you who wanted to have the party

885
01:15:05,708 --> 01:15:07,583
I asked you to dance but you refused

886
01:15:07,708 --> 01:15:08,542
Dance?

887
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,667
I dance like a crab!

888
01:15:11,792 --> 01:15:14,708
I sing like a crow!

889
01:15:15,292 --> 01:15:16,875
Wherere you going?

890
01:15:17,292 --> 01:15:19,292
Nowhere!

891
01:15:19,375 --> 01:15:23,000
Whoever messes with us will get it!

892
01:15:23,125 --> 01:15:24,792
Right?

893
01:15:27,625 --> 01:15:29,292
You're going to fight?

894
01:15:29,375 --> 01:15:30,875
Yeah, so?

895
01:15:30,958 --> 01:15:33,000
We're all experienced fighters

896
01:15:33,125 --> 01:15:36,500
From Shanghai to Hong Kong,
from Hong Kong to New York

897
01:15:36,583 --> 01:15:38,417
We've seen it all! Right?

898
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:39,917
Right!

899
01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:42,583
Figgy, you've been drinking

900
01:15:42,708 --> 01:15:45,458
Why, is there a law against drinking?

901
01:15:45,542 --> 01:15:48,833
Can I let my buddies down
if they get me drinks?

902
01:15:48,958 --> 01:15:50,500
Dumb broad! Let's go!

903
01:15:50,917 --> 01:15:52,750
Figgy, don't go

904
01:15:53,583 --> 01:16:00,875
Figgy. .where're you going?

905
01:16:00,958 --> 01:16:03,917
Jenny, you are crazy!

906
01:16:15,875 --> 01:16:16,875
See, you two don't get along!

907
01:16:17,542 --> 01:16:18,583
Leave me alone!

908
01:17:37,625 --> 01:17:40,083
My name is Sampan

909
01:17:41,417 --> 01:17:43,583
I'm 34 years old

910
01:17:43,708 --> 01:17:47,625
I am born in November 9

911
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,875
November 9?

912
01:17:53,333 --> 01:17:54,833
November 9?

913
01:18:21,333 --> 01:18:22,417
Where are they?

914
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:26,583
Those assholes usually hang around here

915
01:18:26,667 --> 01:18:30,625
Where the hell are they?

916
01:18:30,708 --> 01:18:32,458
Dammit! Where are they?

917
01:18:36,708 --> 01:18:38,583
There!

918
01:18:38,875 --> 01:18:39,833
It's them?

919
01:18:39,958 --> 01:18:41,667
Right!

920
01:18:46,667 --> 01:18:48,000
It's them? -Right

921
01:18:48,125 --> 01:18:51,583
Fucking assholes! How dare you mess with us!

922
01:18:52,375 --> 01:18:53,500
Go get him!

923
01:20:31,125 --> 01:20:33,000
This flower is for you, my dear

924
01:20:34,083 --> 01:20:35,542
Look at the girl over there

925
01:20:43,542 --> 01:20:45,458
I'll be right back

926
01:20:50,542 --> 01:20:53,708
This flower is for you. Have a good day

927
01:20:54,583 --> 01:20:56,875
Thank you -Take care. Bye

928
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:57,917
Bye

929
01:21:49,167 --> 01:21:52,000
Anna...

930
01:21:52,083 --> 01:21:56,542
Jenny...!

931
01:22:00,417 --> 01:22:02,292
Hi, Mrs Sherwood

932
01:22:02,542 --> 01:22:04,750
Good morning

933
01:22:07,833 --> 01:22:11,000
How about coming back to babysit Anna?

934
01:22:11,083 --> 01:22:12,625
She misses you

935
01:22:13,708 --> 01:22:16,750
That day.. .1 know it's not your fault

936
01:22:17,042 --> 01:22:19,917
Jenny, please come back!

937
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,417
Let me think about it

938
01:22:22,542 --> 01:22:24,000
Why don't you move in with us...

939
01:22:25,042 --> 01:22:26,667
you don't have...

940
01:22:26,792 --> 01:22:28,417
any relatives here anyway

941
01:22:28,583 --> 01:22:31,625
She does! She has a cousin, Piggy

942
01:22:33,042 --> 01:22:35,708
Silly girl! Cousin Figgy went away

943
01:22:36,583 --> 01:22:37,542
Move in with us then

944
01:22:37,625 --> 01:22:40,583
We can live like one family

945
01:22:40,875 --> 01:22:45,500
Come on, ]ennifer

946
01:23:06,750 --> 01:23:09,083
See ya, brothers

947
01:24:19,375 --> 01:24:20,583
See you -Bye bye

948
01:24:21,542 --> 01:24:22,667
Hello, my friend

949
01:24:22,792 --> 01:24:25,375
Hello, young man. I remember you

950
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:26,500
This

951
01:24:33,708 --> 01:24:35,958
How much? -Eight hundred

952
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:38,875
One hundred?

953
01:24:38,958 --> 01:24:40,958
No, eight hundred

954
01:24:41,083 --> 01:24:42,708
Come, come

955
01:24:45,083 --> 01:24:46,667
Car. Give you

956
01:24:46,875 --> 01:24:49,750
What's the use of giving me the car?

957
01:24:54,917 --> 01:24:56,542
All give you

958
01:24:58,500 --> 01:24:59,667
Al right...

959
01:24:59,792 --> 01:25:01,667
Thank you!

960
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:02,542
Bye

961
01:26:46,333 --> 01:26:47,625
Jenny

962
01:26:55,542 --> 01:26:56,833
You're still here

963
01:26:58,625 --> 01:26:59,917
I've decided to stay in New York with you

964
01:27:02,708 --> 01:27:03,833
Stay if you like...

965
01:27:03,958 --> 01:27:05,667
but don't say it's because of me

966
01:27:06,458 --> 01:27:08,375
You choose the place that suits you best

967
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:13,875
I thought about it clearly.
New York fits me best!

968
01:27:18,667 --> 01:27:20,417
Today you say New York...

969
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:22,500
tomorrow you'll say Boston

970
01:27:22,625 --> 01:27:24,917
Anyway it doesn't matter. Your family is rich

971
01:27:26,042 --> 01:27:27,625
I won't depend on my family anymore

972
01:27:28,625 --> 01:27:30,000
Could you get me a job?

973
01:27:30,458 --> 01:27:34,875
You, work?
You wont even get enough for your car

974
01:27:35,625 --> 01:27:37,542
Besides, I won't be able to help you

975
01:27:38,667 --> 01:27:40,625
I'm moving to Long Island...

976
01:27:40,708 --> 01:27:42,583
to stay with the family I babysit

977
01:27:44,417 --> 01:27:45,625
You still mad at me?

978
01:27:47,458 --> 01:27:48,750
You know when I first got here alone...

979
01:27:48,833 --> 01:27:50,708
I was confused and running around

980
01:27:51,833 --> 01:27:53,500
Now I want to settle down

981
01:27:55,542 --> 01:27:56,792
But I don't

982
01:27:59,958 --> 01:28:01,417
I didn't sleep last night...

983
01:28:02,833 --> 01:28:04,708
thinking about you

984
01:28:07,542 --> 01:28:09,500
Three people didn't sleep last night!

985
01:28:11,375 --> 01:28:12,667
Let me go and finish packing

986
01:28:17,958 --> 01:28:20,542
Well, let me drive you to Long Island

987
01:28:20,625 --> 01:28:24,000
Airight, I'll go get the rest

988
01:29:03,167 --> 01:29:06,042
Hi, how are you? -Hi, how are you?

989
01:29:07,333 --> 01:29:08,542
I'll wait for you in the car

990
01:29:09,875 --> 01:29:14,500
You're moving?

991
01:29:16,542 --> 01:29:18,792
Yes, I'm moving to Long Island

992
01:29:21,958 --> 01:29:25,708
Oh, Long Island is nice. Very pretty in Autumn

993
01:29:30,083 --> 01:29:34,250
Here's my address.
Come see me when you've time

994
01:29:41,542 --> 01:29:44,042
Okay.. someday

995
01:29:44,833 --> 01:29:46,958
Yes.. someday

996
01:29:53,208 --> 01:29:58,875
Oh, Sis 13. I got something for you

997
01:29:59,917 --> 01:30:01,083
Thanks

998
01:30:03,708 --> 01:30:05,625
Why didn't you tell me...

999
01:30:06,792 --> 01:30:08,625
it was your birthday?

1000
01:30:11,417 --> 01:30:13,875
Why tell anyone, as long as I'm happy

1001
01:30:21,167 --> 01:30:22,958
Best wishes

1002
01:30:23,042 --> 01:30:26,042
Wait, I have something for you too

1003
01:30:32,667 --> 01:30:34,000
Happy birthday

1004
01:30:36,333 --> 01:30:37,292
Thanks

1005
01:30:51,875 --> 01:30:53,667
Bye...

1006
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:56,083
Take care

1007
01:35:48,583 --> 01:35:50,000
Anna, you like it here?

1008
01:35:50,083 --> 01:35:53,875
Yeah.
Let's spend our summer vacation here. Okay?

1009
01:35:55,708 --> 01:35:58,000
Sure, we could sit on the beach and...

1010
01:35:58,083 --> 01:35:59,750
enjoy the breeze at night

1011
01:35:59,875 --> 01:36:01,750
I used to have a friend

1012
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:05,000
whose dream is just to open a restaurant here.

1013
01:36:05,625 --> 01:36:07,333
Facing the Atlantic

1014
01:36:07,833 --> 01:36:11,792
And call the restaurant 'Sampan'

1015
01:36:13,750 --> 01:36:14,792
Sampan?

1016
01:36:15,083 --> 01:36:19,708
Yes, Sampan, Samuel Pang

1017
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,917
Like the one over there?

1018
01:36:43,583 --> 01:36:45,583
I hope you enjoy the food

1019
01:36:45,667 --> 01:36:48,333
Thank you. Bye. You're welcome

1020
01:36:48,667 --> 01:36:51,708
Bye...

1021
01:37:36,083 --> 01:37:37,292
Table or two?
