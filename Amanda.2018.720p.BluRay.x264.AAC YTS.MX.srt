1
00:00:32,775 --> 00:00:34,472
- Bye, Amanda.
- See you!

2
00:01:18,132 --> 00:01:19,362
You're still here?

3
00:01:20,236 --> 00:01:22,173
David's picking me up today.

4
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,336
- David?
- Mummy's brother.

5
00:01:25,681 --> 00:01:27,583
Anyway, come in.

6
00:01:27,718 --> 00:01:29,483
You can't sit there all alone.

7
00:01:50,631 --> 00:01:53,364
- Hello.
- Hello, I'm here for Amanda Sorel.

8
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,401
- Door's open.
- Thanks.

9
00:02:00,483 --> 00:02:02,317
Great little routine you have.

10
00:02:14,177 --> 00:02:17,514
If your meal has things you don't like,

11
00:02:17,752 --> 00:02:21,283
do you eat them up first or save them for last?

12
00:02:23,396 --> 00:02:25,868
- I start with what I don't like.
- Same here.

13
00:02:25,934 --> 00:02:29,396
I'm not picky but sometimes,
I scoop into the mint

14
00:02:29,574 --> 00:02:30,839
stuff I don't like.

15
00:02:31,578 --> 00:02:32,569
Nice.

16
00:02:32,682 --> 00:02:34,174
That's naughty.

17
00:02:35,186 --> 00:02:36,587
What's your favourite meal?

18
00:02:38,326 --> 00:02:39,853
Fish fingers and macaroni.

19
00:02:40,563 --> 00:02:42,899
Joke for you. What's the youngest fish?

20
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:45,567
Mummy!

21
00:02:48,446 --> 00:02:51,419
What happened? School left me four messages.

22
00:02:51,585 --> 00:02:54,456
My Indian tourists arrived 30 minutes late.

23
00:02:54,524 --> 00:02:55,549
Sorry, I was stuck.

24
00:02:55,626 --> 00:02:58,531
She was alone in the street. Just imagine.

25
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:00,593
It's cool, she was inside.

26
00:03:00,771 --> 00:03:02,365
Come on, she's 7 years old,

27
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,274
on the street while you run your scam.

28
00:03:05,346 --> 00:03:07,510
It's all ok, calm down.

29
00:03:07,684 --> 00:03:09,815
Mummy, honestly, it wasn't for long.

30
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:10,816
See?

31
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:12,794
Leave her out of this.

32
00:03:12,895 --> 00:03:13,761
Whatever.

33
00:03:14,866 --> 00:03:16,267
See you soon, Amanda.

34
00:03:16,335 --> 00:03:18,499
- What are you doing?
- Catch you later.

35
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,809
Yeah, right.

36
00:03:25,821 --> 00:03:26,881
Mummy...

37
00:03:27,357 --> 00:03:28,759
Is David angry?

38
00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:30,792
I don't know.

39
00:03:31,766 --> 00:03:33,531
If he is, not at you.

40
00:03:34,604 --> 00:03:36,370
- Any homework?
- Yes.

41
00:03:36,575 --> 00:03:38,205
Let me see, will you?

42
00:03:39,681 --> 00:03:41,208
Are you angry?

43
00:03:41,685 --> 00:03:43,588
No, toots, don't worry.

44
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,299
What's that mean?

45
00:03:53,342 --> 00:03:55,404
It's an expression in English.

46
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,312
From America, in fact.

47
00:03:57,617 --> 00:03:58,985
What's an expression?

48
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,317
An expression is...

49
00:04:03,262 --> 00:04:06,292
It's when you say something in a language

50
00:04:06,936 --> 00:04:09,773
using imagery, kind of creating images.

51
00:04:09,942 --> 00:04:12,709
For example, out like a light.

52
00:04:12,781 --> 00:04:14,648
It's imagery. Someone's passed out.

53
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:15,752
Understand?

54
00:04:15,821 --> 00:04:17,883
And Elvis whatever? What's that?

55
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:18,886
Elvis Presley

56
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,865
was a famous American singer. He's dead now.

57
00:04:21,933 --> 00:04:24,530
He was really famous with lots of fans.

58
00:04:24,704 --> 00:04:27,438
And lots of people, after his concerts,

59
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:32,679
hung around the hall in the hope of glimpsing Elvis again.

60
00:04:33,055 --> 00:04:37,724
One day, a man went back on stage,
grabbed the mic and said...

61
00:04:40,871 --> 00:04:44,538
It was a way of saying,
Elvis has gone, go home now.

62
00:04:44,611 --> 00:04:45,580
You see?

63
00:04:45,948 --> 00:04:46,677
And now,

64
00:04:46,748 --> 00:04:51,282
it's become a famous expression
that people use to say...

65
00:04:52,627 --> 00:04:56,568
Don't bother hanging around, hoping.
It's done, it's over.

66
00:04:56,635 --> 00:04:58,606
All right. That's funny.

67
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,605
I'll play you an Elvis song and that man.

68
00:05:01,846 --> 00:05:03,908
We'll find him on internet.

69
00:06:24,811 --> 00:06:26,042
Excuse me!

70
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:28,783
You're not David, are you?

71
00:06:28,852 --> 00:06:29,684
Sure.

72
00:06:30,422 --> 00:06:32,086
- Lena, is that right?
- Yes.

73
00:06:36,168 --> 00:06:37,603
- Hi.
- Hi.

74
00:06:38,472 --> 00:06:40,500
You didn't have trouble finding it?

75
00:06:40,676 --> 00:06:43,148
I got a cab from the station. It was fine.

76
00:06:44,184 --> 00:06:45,517
Any other bags?

77
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:46,915
The trunk there.

78
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:49,119
Hold on, I'll carry it up.

79
00:06:49,694 --> 00:06:50,890
Ok, thanks.

80
00:06:51,765 --> 00:06:52,859
It's on the 3rd floor.

81
00:06:54,037 --> 00:06:55,062
That's the front door.

82
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:58,806
The round one's the courtyard. After 8 pm,
it's locked.

83
00:06:59,614 --> 00:07:02,485
Wifi info is on the box in the dresser.

84
00:07:02,653 --> 00:07:03,849
Password and stuff.

85
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:06,685
I nearly forgot, the shower...

86
00:07:07,096 --> 00:07:08,622
The tap's upside down.

87
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:12,103
You need to turn it hard to
get hot water running.

88
00:07:12,173 --> 00:07:13,767
Just be patient.

89
00:07:19,654 --> 00:07:23,527
Looks like someone came by to repair it.
That's great.

90
00:08:01,805 --> 00:08:05,678
Sorry to bother you but have you got a pen?

91
00:08:05,746 --> 00:08:07,649
Sure, won't be a second.

92
00:08:17,203 --> 00:08:18,729
- Thanks.
- No problem.

93
00:08:18,905 --> 00:08:20,842
- Good night.
- Night.

94
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,244
Hello, your bag, please.

95
00:08:29,694 --> 00:08:30,560
That's fine.

96
00:08:30,796 --> 00:08:34,567
I'm looking for the language lab,
the English room.

97
00:08:34,637 --> 00:08:36,801
Languages, down the hall on your left.

98
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,003
Thanks.

99
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,792
You know what you did was wrong.

100
00:08:50,102 --> 00:08:52,039
You won't get away with this.

101
00:08:52,206 --> 00:08:53,675
If necessary, I'll sue.

102
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,872
- You won't sue.
- Watch me.

103
00:08:57,249 --> 00:08:58,513
What's going on?

104
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,987
Sue if you want, but it's not the solution.

105
00:09:02,059 --> 00:09:04,530
Let's discuss it, all 4 of us.

106
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,826
We'll come to see you with Rudy.

107
00:09:07,001 --> 00:09:07,935
Thank you.

108
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,640
Ok?

109
00:09:11,611 --> 00:09:12,545
Yes.

110
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,275
Shall we go?

111
00:09:15,719 --> 00:09:18,089
I'll just pick up my things
from the staff room.

112
00:09:19,227 --> 00:09:20,992
What happened exactly?

113
00:09:21,064 --> 00:09:23,934
A kid who keeps baiting me. I shook him.

114
00:09:24,637 --> 00:09:25,662
That's all.

115
00:09:28,245 --> 00:09:30,807
Sorry for arriving late the other day.

116
00:09:32,219 --> 00:09:33,711
That's why you came?

117
00:09:33,788 --> 00:09:34,552
No.

118
00:09:35,092 --> 00:09:37,290
No, I have a favour to ask.

119
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:41,796
Simonian wants me to translate
rental agreement clauses into English.

120
00:09:42,071 --> 00:09:44,873
You know English is not my first love.

121
00:09:45,846 --> 00:09:48,318
I knew you'd have an ulterior motive.

122
00:09:48,818 --> 00:09:51,188
There you go, seeing the bad in everything.

123
00:10:16,841 --> 00:10:19,143
When are you going to buy a real bike?

124
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,614
What's wrong with my bike?

125
00:10:21,684 --> 00:10:23,814
It's an antique, it goes at snail speed.

126
00:10:24,022 --> 00:10:25,322
Don't talk nonsense.

127
00:10:26,761 --> 00:10:28,163
Hurry up and get your licence.

128
00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:31,169
Attacks!

129
00:10:33,908 --> 00:10:34,842
Cheat!

130
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:37,815
- What do you mean?
- I don't have any gears.

131
00:10:37,883 --> 00:10:40,081
And I do? It's all in my legs!

132
00:10:40,622 --> 00:10:41,647
Wait for me!

133
00:11:01,764 --> 00:11:04,396
If you put air in your tyre, you'd go faster.

134
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,803
I don't own a pump.

135
00:11:06,774 --> 00:11:09,212
I'll bring mine next time to see to it.

136
00:11:11,184 --> 00:11:12,778
Your translation by noon, ok?

137
00:11:12,953 --> 00:11:14,184
Any time, thanks.

138
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:16,193
Come and eat one night. I'll call.

139
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,354
Sure, you bet.

140
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:19,657
- Love ya!
- Love ya!

141
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,751
David.

142
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,131
- Hi there.
- Hi there.

143
00:11:36,868 --> 00:11:38,167
What are you doing here?

144
00:11:39,072 --> 00:11:40,235
I came for a run.

145
00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:42,144
So I see. Looking good.

146
00:11:43,214 --> 00:11:44,774
You're also a gardener?

147
00:11:45,017 --> 00:11:47,717
No, I'm a trimmer, up in the trees.

148
00:11:47,823 --> 00:11:50,021
For the city's Parks and Gardens.

149
00:11:50,194 --> 00:11:53,031
It's occasional.
They call me when they need me.

150
00:11:53,368 --> 00:11:54,428
Actually...

151
00:11:56,741 --> 00:11:57,710
Here.

152
00:11:58,445 --> 00:11:59,846
And the socks?

153
00:12:00,482 --> 00:12:02,453
I don't carry socks around.

154
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:04,820
I know, I'm kidding. It was a joke.

155
00:12:06,928 --> 00:12:07,828
Thanks a lot.

156
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,239
Have a good day.

157
00:12:26,968 --> 00:12:28,268
Lena, Flat 104

158
00:12:28,438 --> 00:12:31,205
How about a drink this evening?

159
00:12:41,998 --> 00:12:42,864
Sure.

160
00:12:43,434 --> 00:12:45,028
Call me. See you later.

161
00:12:49,012 --> 00:12:51,348
How'd you end up working for Simonian?

162
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:52,976
By chance basically.

163
00:12:53,153 --> 00:12:56,491
I was working as a painter
when he bought part of the building.

164
00:12:56,861 --> 00:12:59,356
He was looking for a kind of coordinator.

165
00:13:00,034 --> 00:13:02,871
He offered me a studio apartment

166
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,376
in return for my work, and that was that.

167
00:13:05,545 --> 00:13:07,174
Right, so he exploits you.

168
00:13:07,783 --> 00:13:09,013
You've summed up my job.

169
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:14,993
Why did you leave Bordeaux?

170
00:13:15,164 --> 00:13:16,794
Bordeaux? I grew up there.

171
00:13:16,968 --> 00:13:19,166
I give piano lessons for a living and...

172
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,934
- Really?
- Yeah.

173
00:13:21,109 --> 00:13:23,445
I was in a band, too, playing gigs locally.

174
00:13:23,815 --> 00:13:25,011
Really?

175
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:31,460
Nearly there,

176
00:13:31,564 --> 00:13:33,056
how about we sit down a while?

177
00:13:34,135 --> 00:13:35,263
Sure, fine.

178
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,441
You don't want me to go in?

179
00:13:41,517 --> 00:13:44,456
I'm keeping you here with me.

180
00:13:48,464 --> 00:13:50,195
What kind of band was it?

181
00:13:50,568 --> 00:13:52,835
Rock. Big melodies.

182
00:13:53,206 --> 00:13:54,506
Pop, basically.

183
00:13:55,412 --> 00:13:58,544
What are your plans? Giving lessons and stuff?

184
00:13:58,951 --> 00:14:01,081
- You have contacts?
- Yeah, some.

185
00:14:01,289 --> 00:14:03,420
I need to advertise for pupils.

186
00:14:04,062 --> 00:14:06,364
I was just thinking...

187
00:14:06,534 --> 00:14:08,971
My sister's daughter wants piano lessons.

188
00:14:09,138 --> 00:14:11,166
- I could ask.
- For sure.

189
00:14:11,342 --> 00:14:13,210
Definitely. I appreciate it.

190
00:14:14,282 --> 00:14:15,445
How old is she?

191
00:14:15,618 --> 00:14:17,418
She's 6 or 7.

192
00:14:17,622 --> 00:14:19,023
7 maybe.

193
00:14:20,294 --> 00:14:23,826
- Are you sure? Not 15 or 16?
- No, I'm sure.

194
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:43,837
Watch out!

195
00:14:57,334 --> 00:14:58,234
Here.

196
00:15:07,388 --> 00:15:09,359
- Is the truck open?
- Sure.

197
00:15:12,131 --> 00:15:13,431
I'll take this.

198
00:15:35,645 --> 00:15:36,909
Hey.

199
00:15:37,716 --> 00:15:40,119
- You do this every day?
- Every other day.

200
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,552
It's our new ritual.

201
00:15:41,924 --> 00:15:44,453
- She eats a cream cake every other day?
- Sure.

202
00:15:49,338 --> 00:15:50,535
Coffee, then?

203
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:51,975
Sure.

204
00:15:54,382 --> 00:15:55,442
Thanks.

205
00:15:57,421 --> 00:15:59,358
What about Axel? Still separated?

206
00:15:59,526 --> 00:16:00,551
Yeah.

207
00:16:00,728 --> 00:16:02,596
But they split up every week.

208
00:16:02,966 --> 00:16:06,201
He's taking it bad.
Seems to be for real this time.

209
00:16:13,253 --> 00:16:14,187
Are you blushing?

210
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,527
- Silly!
- You are!

211
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,430
As soon as you finish, bedtime.

212
00:16:25,712 --> 00:16:28,411
Hitting on married men again on Facebook?

213
00:16:28,584 --> 00:16:31,614
You know I had no idea he was married!

214
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:34,554
No, I'm done with married men.

215
00:16:39,606 --> 00:16:41,337
What? Come on!

216
00:16:41,409 --> 00:16:42,743
I want a smoke.

217
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,984
Enjoying it?

218
00:16:52,164 --> 00:16:53,566
Ok, I'm seeing someone.

219
00:16:53,734 --> 00:16:54,998
A shrink?

220
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:57,099
You idiot.

221
00:16:57,642 --> 00:16:58,667
Who is it?

222
00:16:59,178 --> 00:17:01,342
A vague friend of Icham and Severine's.

223
00:17:02,051 --> 00:17:03,315
Where did you meet him?

224
00:17:03,788 --> 00:17:05,257
On Facebook.

225
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:08,526
He's not married, honestly. He's separated.

226
00:17:08,697 --> 00:17:10,531
Just like the other guy.

227
00:17:10,601 --> 00:17:14,234
Until he posted pics of wife
and children on vacation.

228
00:17:14,442 --> 00:17:15,537
He's separated, I said.

229
00:17:15,611 --> 00:17:18,310
Guys on Facebook love girls like you.

230
00:17:18,383 --> 00:17:21,653
Like me? It's easy for you, but I've got Amanda.

231
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,453
I'm stuck here every night.

232
00:17:25,197 --> 00:17:27,567
He's different, works at the National Library.

233
00:17:28,336 --> 00:17:29,567
Yup, that's different.

234
00:17:31,577 --> 00:17:32,568
His name's Ivan.

235
00:17:32,745 --> 00:17:34,009
Ivan?

236
00:17:34,515 --> 00:17:36,110
That can't be easy.

237
00:17:36,285 --> 00:17:37,687
I like it a lot.

238
00:17:39,693 --> 00:17:42,460
At first, it was complicated
but that's changing.

239
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:45,031
He wants us to give it a try.

240
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:46,633
That's great.

241
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,744
I'm happy for you.

242
00:17:49,545 --> 00:17:51,209
If you need me to vet him...

243
00:17:51,282 --> 00:17:53,082
Can we read a story?

244
00:17:53,486 --> 00:17:55,252
Yes, I'm coming.

245
00:17:56,425 --> 00:17:57,690
First, though, a surprise.

246
00:17:58,096 --> 00:17:58,689
For me?

247
00:17:59,231 --> 00:18:00,599
A surprise?

248
00:18:05,611 --> 00:18:07,376
- What is it?
- Open it.

249
00:18:10,554 --> 00:18:11,420
You're nuts!

250
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:13,587
Thank you!

251
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:15,323
Wonderful.

252
00:18:15,463 --> 00:18:17,457
I got 3, so we can tag along.

253
00:18:17,635 --> 00:18:19,332
Let me think about it.

254
00:18:19,505 --> 00:18:21,476
What's the surprise then?

255
00:18:21,542 --> 00:18:22,567
Look!

256
00:18:23,112 --> 00:18:24,547
A tennis tournament in London.

257
00:18:24,716 --> 00:18:27,278
- It's a chance to get away together.
- Cool.

258
00:18:27,454 --> 00:18:28,822
- It's Wimbledon!
- Sure!

259
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,458
- It'll bring back memories.
- Stop it.

260
00:18:31,529 --> 00:18:34,731
And it's London.
Amanda and I keep saying we'll go.

261
00:18:35,103 --> 00:18:36,265
2 birds with 1 stone.

262
00:18:36,439 --> 00:18:37,739
My down-to-earth sister.

263
00:18:37,809 --> 00:18:39,780
Alison's entirely different.

264
00:18:40,146 --> 00:18:42,208
So we're going on a trip to London and all?

265
00:18:42,284 --> 00:18:43,480
And all what?

266
00:18:43,553 --> 00:18:45,615
Seeing Mummy's mummy.

267
00:18:46,827 --> 00:18:50,164
You get the train tickets, I'll handle the rest.

268
00:18:50,901 --> 00:18:53,463
A friend's family has a place there.

269
00:18:53,539 --> 00:18:56,775
It's way out of town to the south
but near the grounds.

270
00:18:57,147 --> 00:18:58,116
Great.

271
00:18:58,383 --> 00:19:00,685
Sandrine, I know you mean well

272
00:19:00,755 --> 00:19:02,384
but I have to tell you,

273
00:19:02,557 --> 00:19:04,859
I won't stand in your way but...

274
00:19:05,363 --> 00:19:07,266
I won't go there to meet Alison.

275
00:19:08,136 --> 00:19:11,371
I got her letter, asking to see us,
but I'm not interested.

276
00:19:12,845 --> 00:19:13,836
Okay.

277
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,811
It's your call anyway.

278
00:19:16,887 --> 00:19:20,122
Her letter triggered this? You could've said.

279
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:22,120
You got it too.

280
00:19:22,297 --> 00:19:23,163
She wrote to both of us.

281
00:19:23,232 --> 00:19:25,635
Except I threw it in the bin.

282
00:19:25,705 --> 00:19:27,903
You don't just resurface 20 years on.

283
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:37,795
I'm very touched, thanks.

284
00:19:37,862 --> 00:19:39,456
I should hope so.

285
00:19:44,943 --> 00:19:45,809
London?

286
00:19:45,878 --> 00:19:47,142
Yeah!

287
00:19:57,501 --> 00:19:58,367
Who is it?

288
00:19:58,503 --> 00:20:01,271
David. I'll come back later if you want.

289
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:04,475
- Hey.
- Hey.

290
00:20:04,648 --> 00:20:07,246
At the local market, I bought kesra.

291
00:20:07,421 --> 00:20:09,449
I got two. Want one?

292
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,559
Thanks.

293
00:20:10,761 --> 00:20:12,732
Come in. You have time for coffee?

294
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:13,768
Sure.

295
00:20:15,771 --> 00:20:18,504
I met Amanda and your sister yesterday.

296
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:21,410
Just for coffee but...

297
00:20:22,819 --> 00:20:24,448
Amanda's very keen.

298
00:20:24,621 --> 00:20:26,489
We'll try out together tomorrow.

299
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:29,229
I'm glad she's learning with you.

300
00:20:29,665 --> 00:20:31,762
You're really close to your sister.

301
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:35,407
So she was as discreet as ever.

302
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:37,808
No, we're very close.

303
00:20:37,882 --> 00:20:39,910
But not enough according to her.

304
00:20:39,986 --> 00:20:41,649
She must've had Amanda young.

305
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,785
And the father?

306
00:20:44,963 --> 00:20:46,364
She decided to leave.

307
00:20:46,532 --> 00:20:48,298
It was a fling.

308
00:20:48,369 --> 00:20:50,306
She raises Amanda alone.

309
00:20:50,473 --> 00:20:51,669
He's not in the picture.

310
00:20:51,877 --> 00:20:55,339
That's something else,
raising your kid on your own.

311
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:57,444
It's not always easy.

312
00:20:58,489 --> 00:21:01,394
Anyway, it's always worked for them both.

313
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:03,729
They seem happy.

314
00:21:03,867 --> 00:21:05,997
We were raised by our father.

315
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,922
You just brought me a kesra?

316
00:21:19,331 --> 00:21:20,493
For sure.

317
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,497
It was a bribe.

318
00:22:03,052 --> 00:22:04,783
Saw you, don't try to hide it.

319
00:22:10,667 --> 00:22:11,761
Leave some for others.

320
00:22:11,836 --> 00:22:13,932
Hey, David, it's me.

321
00:22:14,107 --> 00:22:16,340
Can you pick up some bread on the way?

322
00:22:16,512 --> 00:22:18,574
I got some but maybe not enough.

323
00:22:18,749 --> 00:22:20,983
I won't have time to drop by the baker's.

324
00:22:21,321 --> 00:22:22,916
I'll never make it on time.

325
00:22:23,726 --> 00:22:25,424
Great, thanks.

326
00:22:28,102 --> 00:22:30,300
- Hi there.
- Hi, sweetie. How are you?

327
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:32,402
Evening, Emmanuelle. You ok?

328
00:22:32,477 --> 00:22:33,343
Fine, and you?

329
00:22:33,412 --> 00:22:34,642
Running late.

330
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,780
For tonight,

331
00:22:36,953 --> 00:22:38,890
help yourself in the fridge.

332
00:22:42,464 --> 00:22:44,332
Can I carry something downstairs?

333
00:22:44,534 --> 00:22:45,366
No, I'm good.

334
00:22:45,436 --> 00:22:47,498
I have a CitiCar booked at the stand.

335
00:22:47,674 --> 00:22:48,871
Bravo for your licence.

336
00:22:48,944 --> 00:22:50,607
It's what we're celebrating.

337
00:22:51,983 --> 00:22:54,853
Have fun. Don't pester Emmanuelle
if she's studying.

338
00:22:55,423 --> 00:22:56,790
Save me some cheese pie.

339
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,554
We'll see about that.

340
00:22:58,729 --> 00:23:00,063
- Enjoy your evening.
- Have fun.

341
00:23:00,133 --> 00:23:01,067
Goodbye.

342
00:23:20,106 --> 00:23:21,541
Hey, Lena, it's me.

343
00:23:21,642 --> 00:23:24,114
Do you mind going alone?

344
00:23:24,848 --> 00:23:27,013
The train's late. It was 20 minutes,

345
00:23:27,086 --> 00:23:28,555
now it's more.

346
00:23:28,656 --> 00:23:30,650
It doesn't even say how much.

347
00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:32,759
No, you go ahead without me.

348
00:23:34,467 --> 00:23:35,731
Yeah, sorry.

349
00:23:35,903 --> 00:23:36,837
Hold on,

350
00:23:36,905 --> 00:23:39,139
can you pick up 3-4 baguettes?

351
00:23:41,481 --> 00:23:42,677
I know it's asking a lot

352
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,812
but Sandrine told me to buy bread.

353
00:23:45,623 --> 00:23:46,592
See you there.

354
00:24:00,988 --> 00:24:01,957
Hello?

355
00:24:02,624 --> 00:24:04,390
Yeah, they arrived in the end.

356
00:24:04,461 --> 00:24:08,027
I'm on Avenue Daumesnil. I'll be 5-10 minutes.

357
00:26:04,834 --> 00:26:05,894
Excuse me,

358
00:26:06,003 --> 00:26:07,871
can I borrow your phone, please?

359
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,034
I lost mine.

360
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,670
- Here.
- Thanks.

361
00:26:42,276 --> 00:26:43,176
Thanks.

362
00:26:44,046 --> 00:26:45,141
Voicemail.

363
00:28:39,243 --> 00:28:41,008
Amanda, it's me. David.

364
00:28:47,927 --> 00:28:49,955
Mummy's still asleep?

365
00:28:51,734 --> 00:28:52,998
She's not here.

366
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:56,137
Where is she?

367
00:29:00,352 --> 00:29:02,414
What are you doing here?

368
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:06,225
How about we get breakfast and walk a little?

369
00:29:32,917 --> 00:29:34,410
Where is everybody?

370
00:29:41,501 --> 00:29:43,995
What's wrong? I want to see Mummy.

371
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,526
Last night, something serious happened

372
00:29:56,898 --> 00:29:59,165
in the park, with Mummy and our friends.

373
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:03,341
Men came along.

374
00:30:05,081 --> 00:30:07,075
They were armed and...

375
00:30:10,224 --> 00:30:13,026
They shot at people who were there

376
00:30:13,565 --> 00:30:15,296
for a picnic or a walk.

377
00:30:16,303 --> 00:30:18,434
They shot a lot of people.

378
00:30:23,283 --> 00:30:25,346
They shot Mummy too.

379
00:30:30,031 --> 00:30:32,868
Why did they shoot people?

380
00:30:33,303 --> 00:30:35,400
When will we see Mummy again?

381
00:30:35,575 --> 00:30:37,238
We won't see her again, Amanda.

382
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:39,908
She's dead.

383
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:44,483
We won't ever see Mummy again.

384
00:30:48,935 --> 00:30:50,336
We'll never see her again.

385
00:30:57,553 --> 00:31:00,024
I want to go. Can we go now?

386
00:31:03,965 --> 00:31:04,990
Okay.

387
00:32:27,298 --> 00:32:28,426
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

388
00:32:29,235 --> 00:32:31,103
- Can't we go in?
- Closed today, sir.

389
00:32:33,511 --> 00:32:35,208
We can't go there?

390
00:32:35,515 --> 00:32:37,246
Sorry, Amanda.

391
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:43,357
It's not a good day to walk around Paris.
Go home, sir.

392
00:32:44,198 --> 00:32:45,258
But...

393
00:32:48,407 --> 00:32:49,307
Thank you.

394
00:34:00,384 --> 00:34:01,547
Hi, sweetheart.

395
00:34:06,329 --> 00:34:07,423
Come in.

396
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,063
A rabbit's got out.

397
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:13,269
He'll be back. He knows his way around.

398
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:14,471
I made sure of that.

399
00:34:14,545 --> 00:34:17,347
- Can I get him?
- Of course, sweetheart.

400
00:34:18,186 --> 00:34:20,123
He doesn't bite. You can pick him up.

401
00:34:20,692 --> 00:34:22,059
What's his name?

402
00:34:22,128 --> 00:34:24,566
He has no name. We'll find him one.

403
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:35,652
How can anyone do something like that?

404
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,035
It's so awful.

405
00:34:50,484 --> 00:34:52,512
How's it going with the rabbit?

406
00:34:53,156 --> 00:34:54,751
He seems nice.

407
00:34:55,494 --> 00:34:57,089
He's soft.

408
00:35:07,852 --> 00:35:09,583
She fell asleep in the end?

409
00:35:09,756 --> 00:35:11,453
Yes, but it was a struggle.

410
00:35:11,627 --> 00:35:13,597
She kept tossing and turning.

411
00:35:15,234 --> 00:35:16,704
Did she mention Sandrine?

412
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:18,741
No. I didn't dare either.

413
00:35:21,479 --> 00:35:22,710
Give it time.

414
00:35:24,686 --> 00:35:27,317
So you're going to the mortuary?

415
00:35:27,524 --> 00:35:28,493
Yes, I am.

416
00:35:28,694 --> 00:35:30,425
A friend's coming with me.

417
00:35:31,399 --> 00:35:33,370
Take the keys on the dresser.

418
00:35:33,436 --> 00:35:35,464
I might be in bed when you get back.

419
00:35:36,209 --> 00:35:37,178
Okay.

420
00:35:37,478 --> 00:35:38,538
I'll be going.

421
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:49,233
The attack was the work of four men,

422
00:35:49,302 --> 00:35:52,605
none of whom are visible on videos shot
at the scene.

423
00:35:52,709 --> 00:35:55,545
The attackers fired rapid bursts
before escaping,

424
00:35:55,715 --> 00:35:59,450
according to eye-witness accounts given
to the police.

425
00:35:59,622 --> 00:36:02,858
Islamist terrorism
is the most plausible explanation.

426
00:36:02,929 --> 00:36:04,193
Good news.

427
00:36:05,267 --> 00:36:07,899
Axel's mother says he's fine after the op.

428
00:36:19,863 --> 00:36:21,628
Any news of your friend?

429
00:36:21,834 --> 00:36:22,859
Lena? Sure.

430
00:36:22,936 --> 00:36:24,166
She's fine.

431
00:36:24,806 --> 00:36:27,209
Lost a lot of blood, needed a transfusion,

432
00:36:27,378 --> 00:36:28,814
but she's improving.

433
00:36:29,248 --> 00:36:31,310
- Could you see her?
- Not so far.

434
00:36:31,386 --> 00:36:33,722
They gave me a number to call her tomorrow.

435
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:41,901
What are you going to do?

436
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:46,714
I need a shower and to get some sleep.

437
00:36:47,484 --> 00:36:49,682
- And you?
- I'll go back to my aunt's.

438
00:36:50,657 --> 00:36:52,355
To be there when Amanda wakes up.

439
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:59,365
Thanks for coming.

440
00:37:06,456 --> 00:37:08,222
- How will you get back?
- Walk.

441
00:37:08,293 --> 00:37:11,494
It's all I've done for 24 hours.
I left my bike somewhere.

442
00:37:11,632 --> 00:37:13,728
I'll catch a cab, want a lift?

443
00:37:13,804 --> 00:37:14,898
No, thanks.

444
00:37:17,311 --> 00:37:18,575
There's one, there.

445
00:37:19,749 --> 00:37:20,682
Bye.

446
00:38:30,624 --> 00:38:33,028
Are there family members who can help?

447
00:38:34,498 --> 00:38:36,731
There's my aunt, Maud.

448
00:38:36,937 --> 00:38:39,738
My father died 3 years ago,
my mother lives in London.

449
00:38:39,808 --> 00:38:42,474
She's never even met Amanda.

450
00:38:42,915 --> 00:38:43,780
Well...

451
00:38:44,518 --> 00:38:47,286
The priority is for Amanda
to have legal status,

452
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:50,364
if only for travel or medical purposes.

453
00:38:50,497 --> 00:38:52,695
That means naming a guardian, you see?

454
00:38:52,869 --> 00:38:53,963
Not really.

455
00:38:54,338 --> 00:38:57,675
The judge will ask a family panel to convene.

456
00:38:57,945 --> 00:39:01,680
From what you say, three people could care
for Amanda.

457
00:39:01,786 --> 00:39:04,554
Your aunt, yourself and your mother.

458
00:39:04,825 --> 00:39:07,924
At the family panel meeting, the judge asks you

459
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:10,901
who agrees to raise Amanda until she's 18.

460
00:39:11,072 --> 00:39:12,063
As her guardian.

461
00:39:12,574 --> 00:39:15,308
- And appoints a subrogate.
- A subrogate?

462
00:39:15,547 --> 00:39:19,511
That's someone who shares oversight
of the guardian with the judge.

463
00:39:19,688 --> 00:39:22,752
I understand. What's the deadline for...

464
00:39:23,029 --> 00:39:25,091
A few weeks maybe.

465
00:39:26,836 --> 00:39:29,866
Your niece needs a father in the legal sense.

466
00:39:30,043 --> 00:39:32,514
For things a minor cannot decide alone.

467
00:39:35,453 --> 00:39:37,686
You're at least 15 years older than her?

468
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:40,489
Yes, she's 7 and I'm 24.

469
00:39:40,931 --> 00:39:43,027
Legally, you could be her guardian.

470
00:39:44,004 --> 00:39:45,998
The decision is yours, of course.

471
00:39:47,778 --> 00:39:49,806
How do you see it working out?

472
00:39:49,916 --> 00:39:50,884
I don't know,

473
00:39:50,951 --> 00:39:53,513
I never imagined raising my niece one day.

474
00:39:53,589 --> 00:39:55,617
I love her lots but...

475
00:39:57,597 --> 00:39:59,899
Does raising her scare you?

476
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:02,073
It's only natural at your age.

477
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,770
And you're grieving too.

478
00:40:42,153 --> 00:40:43,816
What are we doing today?

479
00:40:44,057 --> 00:40:46,790
When I'm done, we meet tenants at the station.

480
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,769
Why the long face?

481
00:40:53,977 --> 00:40:56,175
We never do anything. We could go out!

482
00:40:56,849 --> 00:40:58,114
Go out where?

483
00:40:58,185 --> 00:41:00,452
People go to see things.

484
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:02,962
Monuments, parks...

485
00:41:03,763 --> 00:41:06,999
Don't throw stuff on the floor.
I have work to do.

486
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:09,141
There's no school today. Nobody's working.

487
00:41:09,207 --> 00:41:10,608
I am!

488
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:11,870
Can't you see that?

489
00:41:31,785 --> 00:41:33,153
Look, I'm sorry.

490
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:36,188
We'll go out tonight if you want.

491
00:41:37,999 --> 00:41:39,992
I'll see about a playdate for you.

492
00:41:47,017 --> 00:41:49,045
Are there games on your phone?

493
00:41:49,755 --> 00:41:51,225
I don't know, I'll look.

494
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:52,891
Can I borrow it?

495
00:41:53,062 --> 00:41:54,463
If you want.

496
00:41:58,906 --> 00:41:59,931
Hi there.

497
00:42:00,109 --> 00:42:01,100
Hello.

498
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,481
Hello, Amanda.

499
00:42:04,918 --> 00:42:08,484
- She chose the flowers.
- They're really pretty.

500
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:09,717
How you doing?

501
00:42:10,763 --> 00:42:11,925
Come on in.

502
00:42:19,948 --> 00:42:21,714
Shit, didn't offer you a drink.

503
00:42:21,785 --> 00:42:23,813
- I've got it.
- No, I gotta move.

504
00:42:24,157 --> 00:42:25,854
They told me to keep moving.

505
00:42:26,295 --> 00:42:28,129
What do you want to drink?

506
00:42:28,999 --> 00:42:30,799
- Dunno.
- I have orange juice.

507
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:32,531
I have water.

508
00:42:33,742 --> 00:42:36,078
I also have orange juice.

509
00:42:36,248 --> 00:42:38,276
And I have water.

510
00:42:38,652 --> 00:42:40,122
- Orange juice then.
- Great.

511
00:42:40,289 --> 00:42:41,280
Excellent choice.

512
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:42,583
A beer?

513
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,854
Coffee's fine.

514
00:42:43,929 --> 00:42:46,766
Ok, let's go. I'm gonna have a beer.

515
00:42:47,804 --> 00:42:49,297
I hear it relieves pain.

516
00:42:55,653 --> 00:42:56,815
How do you feel?

517
00:42:58,092 --> 00:42:59,220
I'm ok.

518
00:43:04,804 --> 00:43:05,864
Seeing a shrink.

519
00:43:06,575 --> 00:43:07,600
Really?

520
00:43:07,977 --> 00:43:10,211
Three sessions with her this week.

521
00:43:11,652 --> 00:43:16,152
If anybody had said to me,
Axel, you'll see a shrink.

522
00:43:18,165 --> 00:43:19,259
Is she good?

523
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:22,169
It feels like I tell her
the same thing every time,

524
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,005
but yes she's good.

525
00:43:25,346 --> 00:43:26,906
I don't get you refusing.

526
00:43:28,051 --> 00:43:29,646
It would do you good.

527
00:43:30,156 --> 00:43:32,889
The Victims Support Group is great.

528
00:43:33,061 --> 00:43:34,725
Yeah, I called them.

529
00:43:34,898 --> 00:43:39,238
They told you how to cover your bases
if this goes to a trial?

530
00:43:39,608 --> 00:43:41,135
- Did they tell you?
- Sure.

531
00:43:41,311 --> 00:43:43,782
I'm not sure I want to get involved in that.

532
00:43:43,849 --> 00:43:44,840
Meet them.

533
00:43:44,918 --> 00:43:47,618
I have no time right now, like I said.

534
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:50,091
You realise what's going on, right?

535
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:51,721
You think it stops there?

536
00:43:51,798 --> 00:43:53,701
Those guys won't keep going?

537
00:43:54,271 --> 00:43:55,900
Do you realise that?

538
00:44:03,656 --> 00:44:04,716
You ok, Amanda?

539
00:44:05,192 --> 00:44:07,595
- I have tummy ache.
- Tummy ache?

540
00:44:07,664 --> 00:44:09,328
Maybe you drank too fast.

541
00:44:09,701 --> 00:44:10,931
Know what we can do?

542
00:44:11,405 --> 00:44:12,931
Put the flowers in a vase.

543
00:44:13,709 --> 00:44:14,336
All right.

544
00:44:14,678 --> 00:44:16,147
Tummy ache all gone!

545
00:44:17,917 --> 00:44:19,113
You scamp!

546
00:44:21,023 --> 00:44:21,889
Hi there.

547
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:23,119
Hi, David.

548
00:44:24,096 --> 00:44:24,928
You ok?

549
00:44:24,998 --> 00:44:26,696
Yeah. Visiting the patient?

550
00:44:26,868 --> 00:44:28,030
Sure.

551
00:44:30,108 --> 00:44:31,271
Hello.

552
00:44:33,282 --> 00:44:34,717
She brought us flowers.

553
00:44:35,252 --> 00:44:36,846
They're really pretty!

554
00:44:36,922 --> 00:44:39,052
- I brought you something too.
- You did?

555
00:44:39,126 --> 00:44:40,026
Yeah.

556
00:44:40,429 --> 00:44:41,261
Here.

557
00:44:45,339 --> 00:44:47,640
Colour-In Workbook.

558
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:48,835
Mine! I want it.

559
00:44:49,012 --> 00:44:50,277
Let's take a look.

560
00:44:50,449 --> 00:44:53,786
You guys go for a walk and I'll stay here
with Amanda.

561
00:44:53,856 --> 00:44:57,729
Sure, we'll go out. Walking does me good.

562
00:44:58,164 --> 00:44:58,962
Let's go.

563
00:45:00,168 --> 00:45:01,798
- See you, girls.
- Bye.

564
00:45:02,407 --> 00:45:03,842
See you later, Amanda.

565
00:45:05,078 --> 00:45:07,380
You know the Game of the Goose?

566
00:45:07,784 --> 00:45:09,311
- It goes round and round?
- Exactly.

567
00:45:13,328 --> 00:45:15,093
Are things better with Raja now?

568
00:45:16,301 --> 00:45:17,702
I guess.

569
00:45:18,405 --> 00:45:20,933
We're in a period outside of time.

570
00:45:21,812 --> 00:45:23,442
She felt so scared that...

571
00:45:25,118 --> 00:45:28,251
But we both know we're experiencing
an interlude.

572
00:45:28,425 --> 00:45:30,692
At some point, we need to get a grip.

573
00:45:30,863 --> 00:45:32,299
You mean splitting up?

574
00:45:32,366 --> 00:45:33,767
It's not what I want.

575
00:45:42,487 --> 00:45:44,218
Bragging rights at stake.

576
00:45:45,426 --> 00:45:47,089
The ginger guy's on it.

577
00:45:47,263 --> 00:45:48,698
- A good player.
- Yeah.

578
00:45:54,277 --> 00:45:55,302
What about you?

579
00:45:57,850 --> 00:46:02,452
Picking her up from school, trimming trees,

580
00:46:02,527 --> 00:46:03,461
working for Simonian,

581
00:46:03,529 --> 00:46:05,932
honestly, I never stop running.

582
00:46:08,372 --> 00:46:10,103
And Amanda? How's she doing?

583
00:46:10,342 --> 00:46:12,506
She hardly ever mentions Sandrine.

584
00:46:13,214 --> 00:46:15,242
Whenever I raise it with her,

585
00:46:15,953 --> 00:46:17,947
she changes the subject or gets mad.

586
00:46:19,126 --> 00:46:22,099
How have you got organised? You moved in there?

587
00:46:22,165 --> 00:46:23,396
Practically.

588
00:46:25,506 --> 00:46:29,002
How do you see things working out?

589
00:46:31,116 --> 00:46:32,176
Dunno.

590
00:46:37,062 --> 00:46:37,962
David.

591
00:47:04,049 --> 00:47:05,177
Fuck!

592
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:07,513
I'm scared, Axel.

593
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:10,793
I don't know what the future holds.

594
00:47:11,498 --> 00:47:14,562
I hung in there till the funeral but honestly...

595
00:47:17,108 --> 00:47:19,272
I don't know, I've no idea.

596
00:47:21,918 --> 00:47:24,857
What future do we have? What will I do with her?

597
00:47:27,363 --> 00:47:28,923
I'm so scared.

598
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,026
I'm not ready

599
00:47:31,571 --> 00:47:33,838
to raise a child like that.

600
00:47:34,209 --> 00:47:37,205
I don't know what she eats, I forget homework...

601
00:47:40,321 --> 00:47:42,953
She's not my kid. I don't know what to do.

602
00:47:46,033 --> 00:47:48,528
She has nobody. We have nobody now.

603
00:47:50,609 --> 00:47:52,910
Raja told you about the Children's Home?

604
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:54,917
I'm going to see the director.

605
00:47:55,619 --> 00:47:57,886
Could be the solution for now.

606
00:47:58,057 --> 00:47:59,584
Until you're back on your feet.

607
00:48:00,629 --> 00:48:02,862
That's funny, coming from you.

608
00:48:04,236 --> 00:48:05,296
Ok, smartass.

609
00:48:25,946 --> 00:48:26,937
Amanda?

610
00:48:31,991 --> 00:48:32,960
What's wrong?

611
00:48:40,007 --> 00:48:41,237
What's the matter?

612
00:48:43,582 --> 00:48:45,450
A nightmare? What's wrong?

613
00:48:46,921 --> 00:48:49,051
Calm down, it's still night.

614
00:48:50,562 --> 00:48:52,031
What's the matter?

615
00:48:54,503 --> 00:48:56,405
Go back to sleep now.

616
00:48:56,574 --> 00:48:58,545
Sleep, lay down.

617
00:49:00,449 --> 00:49:02,009
Calm down.

618
00:49:04,624 --> 00:49:05,957
Amanda, talk to me.

619
00:49:06,126 --> 00:49:07,562
Talk to me, please.

620
00:49:09,099 --> 00:49:10,227
Fuck it!

621
00:49:10,535 --> 00:49:12,300
I'm here, it's fine.

622
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:14,402
Hold my hand.

623
00:49:14,977 --> 00:49:16,276
I'm here.

624
00:49:16,714 --> 00:49:18,047
I'm here.

625
00:49:26,066 --> 00:49:27,035
I'm here.

626
00:49:52,619 --> 00:49:53,679
Hey there.

627
00:49:55,324 --> 00:49:57,295
I told you not to bother.

628
00:49:57,462 --> 00:49:58,693
I could call a cab.

629
00:49:59,065 --> 00:50:00,968
It's not about a cab or not.

630
00:50:01,136 --> 00:50:02,400
Hold on, let me help.

631
00:50:13,728 --> 00:50:14,958
You ok?

632
00:50:15,532 --> 00:50:16,523
Yes.

633
00:50:18,103 --> 00:50:20,199
Sorry, David, I...

634
00:50:20,575 --> 00:50:22,272
I'm sorry but...

635
00:50:22,713 --> 00:50:24,741
I don't think I'll be good company.

636
00:50:25,585 --> 00:50:27,350
I think I need to be alone.

637
00:50:28,157 --> 00:50:29,421
I'm really sorry.

638
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:33,691
No, I totally understand.

639
00:50:36,306 --> 00:50:40,509
I'll carry this up, get you settled
in and leave you alone.

640
00:50:42,151 --> 00:50:43,245
Thanks.

641
00:51:47,749 --> 00:51:49,743
- What's that?
- A yurt.

642
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:51,721
A Mongolian dwelling.

643
00:51:52,091 --> 00:51:53,652
It's about raising their awareness

644
00:51:53,828 --> 00:51:57,461
about alternative and eco-friendly housing.

645
00:51:58,403 --> 00:51:59,599
As I was saying,

646
00:51:59,773 --> 00:52:02,370
the idea is for the children

647
00:52:02,545 --> 00:52:06,213
to escape being conditioned
like performing animals.

648
00:52:06,419 --> 00:52:08,481
Instead, they should learn

649
00:52:08,658 --> 00:52:11,825
to be uncompromising and inquisitive

650
00:52:12,198 --> 00:52:14,101
in their daily activities.

651
00:52:14,269 --> 00:52:17,436
It must always connect to something practical.

652
00:52:20,347 --> 00:52:22,683
Are you Amanda's only family?

653
00:52:24,222 --> 00:52:25,817
There's my father's sister.

654
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:27,654
And...

655
00:52:32,271 --> 00:52:34,333
All these children are orphans?

656
00:52:34,575 --> 00:52:35,840
For the most part.

657
00:52:36,212 --> 00:52:41,554
There are also children
who have been removed from their parents.

658
00:52:42,558 --> 00:52:43,755
I was wondering,

659
00:52:43,928 --> 00:52:46,901
are you flexible about home visits?

660
00:52:47,268 --> 00:52:50,241
We're very flexible
about what happens inside school

661
00:52:50,307 --> 00:52:53,839
but very strict about days out.

662
00:52:54,449 --> 00:52:58,481
The kids, especially younger ones,
wouldn't understand some going home

663
00:52:58,657 --> 00:53:01,722
while others stay here almost all year round.

664
00:53:01,897 --> 00:53:04,734
The two periods when we relax the rules

665
00:53:04,937 --> 00:53:07,306
are the holiday period in December

666
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:09,241
and the summer,

667
00:53:09,412 --> 00:53:11,406
in the first half of August.

668
00:53:14,422 --> 00:53:16,256
You seem perplexed.

669
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:17,659
Not at all.

670
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:43,211
I'm running late, I've had a tricky day.

671
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,717
Don't worry, we did her homework, we ate...

672
00:53:45,885 --> 00:53:48,254
We played even, didn't we, Amanda?

673
00:53:48,423 --> 00:53:50,257
I'm starting to teach her chess.

674
00:53:50,427 --> 00:53:51,954
Really? Isn't she a bit young?

675
00:53:52,364 --> 00:53:54,358
No, she's picking it up.

676
00:53:54,435 --> 00:53:55,426
The horse is hard.

677
00:53:55,504 --> 00:53:57,908
We'll revise the Knight and Bishop.

678
00:53:59,545 --> 00:54:00,411
We'll be going.

679
00:54:00,581 --> 00:54:01,744
Ready? Grab your bag.

680
00:54:02,451 --> 00:54:03,853
I don't want to go.

681
00:54:03,955 --> 00:54:05,789
Why? You're seeing Maud tomorrow.

682
00:54:05,859 --> 00:54:07,658
I want to stay here tonight.

683
00:54:08,230 --> 00:54:11,362
You're always welcome but school's miles away.

684
00:54:11,536 --> 00:54:12,630
It means an early start.

685
00:54:12,705 --> 00:54:15,200
I'm sick of always moving around.

686
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:18,818
Who am I going to live with? You or Maud?

687
00:54:21,289 --> 00:54:22,314
Amanda.

688
00:54:22,424 --> 00:54:25,420
It's a strange time we're going through.

689
00:54:25,597 --> 00:54:29,402
For you, obviously and most importantly,
but for David too.

690
00:54:31,442 --> 00:54:35,942
I really enjoy spending time with you
but it's good for you to be with David.

691
00:54:36,286 --> 00:54:38,382
He has energy I don't have, see?

692
00:54:39,392 --> 00:54:40,725
I'm changing schools, too?

693
00:54:40,795 --> 00:54:44,235
No. We're going home tonight
to be closer to school.

694
00:54:44,635 --> 00:54:45,660
I want to stay here.

695
00:54:45,737 --> 00:54:46,762
This isn't funny.

696
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,002
I want to stay!

697
00:56:59,471 --> 00:57:00,701
What time is it?

698
00:57:00,874 --> 00:57:02,003
Dunno.

699
00:57:04,582 --> 00:57:06,519
Quickly or we'll be late.

700
00:57:06,686 --> 00:57:09,056
I'll buy you a croissant for breakfast.

701
00:57:09,158 --> 00:57:10,958
- A pain au chocolat.
- If you want.

702
00:57:11,028 --> 00:57:12,463
Go and wash.

703
00:57:20,113 --> 00:57:21,776
Where's her toothbrush?

704
00:57:24,421 --> 00:57:26,016
Where's Mummy's toothbrush?

705
00:57:28,196 --> 00:57:31,169
I put it away. We can't leave it there.

706
00:57:31,535 --> 00:57:32,526
Don't you think?

707
00:57:32,704 --> 00:57:34,732
You have no right, it's not yours!

708
00:57:35,043 --> 00:57:36,569
This isn't your house!

709
00:57:36,646 --> 00:57:38,446
You don't decide on toothbrushes.

710
00:57:39,952 --> 00:57:41,047
Ok, I'm sorry.

711
00:57:42,624 --> 00:57:44,720
- I'll put it back.
- Right now.

712
00:57:44,895 --> 00:57:45,522
Now!

713
00:57:45,597 --> 00:57:48,832
I swear I will but we need to hurry now.

714
00:58:21,202 --> 00:58:22,466
Let's go.

715
00:58:26,145 --> 00:58:27,614
Shit, your bag!

716
00:59:14,174 --> 00:59:15,108
Here.

717
00:59:15,777 --> 00:59:16,973
Have a good day!

718
00:59:17,247 --> 00:59:19,115
Maud's picking you up tonight.

719
00:59:19,785 --> 00:59:21,551
You'll sleep over at hers.

720
00:59:38,156 --> 00:59:39,055
David.

721
00:59:39,892 --> 00:59:41,054
Lydia!

722
00:59:41,996 --> 00:59:43,762
- How are you?
- It's been ages.

723
00:59:43,833 --> 00:59:44,733
Yeah.

724
00:59:44,801 --> 00:59:46,065
You haven't changed.

725
00:59:46,138 --> 00:59:47,664
Didn't you move to Lyon?

726
00:59:47,741 --> 00:59:50,543
I moved back to Paris two years ago.

727
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:53,619
The company Victor
and I started didn't work out.

728
00:59:53,686 --> 00:59:55,657
Then we split up and that's it.

729
00:59:55,823 --> 00:59:57,657
I took over from my parents.

730
00:59:57,727 --> 00:59:59,094
- The restaurant?
- Yeah.

731
00:59:59,298 --> 01:00:01,029
I'm manager-slash-server.

732
01:00:01,101 --> 01:00:03,231
And Marco, my cousin, you know...

733
01:00:03,706 --> 01:00:05,904
He's in the kitchen.

734
01:00:06,245 --> 01:00:08,978
Drop by. You guys know where to find us.

735
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:11,085
What about you?

736
01:00:11,789 --> 01:00:14,022
I keep pretty busy with various things

737
01:00:14,093 --> 01:00:17,864
but my main job's
with a big-time landlord in Paris.

738
01:00:18,001 --> 01:00:20,769
I'm the interface with tenants or tourists.

739
01:00:21,141 --> 01:00:25,810
Last time I saw your sister,
she said you were with Parks and Gardens.

740
01:00:26,285 --> 01:00:27,584
That as well.

741
01:00:28,389 --> 01:00:30,086
Ok, so how's Sandrine?

742
01:00:30,393 --> 01:00:31,794
She said we talked?

743
01:00:31,862 --> 01:00:34,699
Maybe 18 months ago, when I moved back.

744
01:00:34,901 --> 01:00:37,305
We said we'd meet and then it flies by.

745
01:00:37,674 --> 01:00:39,702
How old's her daughter now? Five?

746
01:00:39,878 --> 01:00:41,212
- Seven.
- Seven?

747
01:00:41,348 --> 01:00:42,817
Unbelievable!

748
01:00:43,219 --> 01:00:44,984
I gotta go.

749
01:00:45,156 --> 01:00:47,923
Tell her I'll call in the next few days.

750
01:00:48,162 --> 01:00:49,324
And drop in for dinner, both of you.

751
01:00:49,398 --> 01:00:51,892
Evenings are better, we can talk.

752
01:00:53,104 --> 01:00:54,802
- See you, David.
- Bye.

753
01:01:43,037 --> 01:01:44,268
- Hi.
- Hi.

754
01:01:44,341 --> 01:01:45,970
- Hi.
- Hi.

755
01:02:00,105 --> 01:02:01,039
How are you?

756
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:02,405
Good, and you?

757
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:04,280
- Good.
- What brings you here?

758
01:02:04,448 --> 01:02:05,883
We came to see you.

759
01:02:06,752 --> 01:02:08,450
- Hi, Amanda.
- Hi.

760
01:02:08,756 --> 01:02:09,417
How are you?

761
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:12,261
Here, take a closer look.

762
01:02:15,503 --> 01:02:16,904
He's funny!

763
01:02:18,309 --> 01:02:20,746
- What's his name?
- Jean-Marco.

764
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:21,905
Jean-Marco?

765
01:02:22,884 --> 01:02:25,185
That's a pretty original name.

766
01:02:25,356 --> 01:02:27,087
I never met a Jean-Marco.

767
01:02:29,998 --> 01:02:31,935
How did it go, back at work?

768
01:02:33,204 --> 01:02:34,799
You saw me.

769
01:02:36,345 --> 01:02:38,782
Geraldine puts trivial stuff my way.

770
01:02:39,751 --> 01:02:41,881
It takes me 3 hours to her 10 minutes.

771
01:02:42,757 --> 01:02:45,821
Obviously, it takes you time
to get back into it.

772
01:02:45,997 --> 01:02:49,061
It will improve with time and some rehab.

773
01:02:49,371 --> 01:02:50,931
You sound like my mother.

774
01:02:51,007 --> 01:02:54,174
Actually, we don't know it'll improve.
We have no idea.

775
01:02:58,221 --> 01:02:59,748
It's a firecracker, don't worry.

776
01:03:00,225 --> 01:03:01,250
You ok?

777
01:03:02,297 --> 01:03:03,288
Yeah.

778
01:03:03,365 --> 01:03:04,800
I'm sorry, I...

779
01:03:04,968 --> 01:03:06,062
Don't apologise.

780
01:03:09,209 --> 01:03:10,736
I'm sorry, Amanda.

781
01:03:10,913 --> 01:03:13,146
No, don't apologise. Let's go.

782
01:03:15,088 --> 01:03:17,286
Smell that. It's not your basic vino.

783
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:18,952
Why smell it?

784
01:03:19,798 --> 01:03:21,962
People who taste wine

785
01:03:22,370 --> 01:03:25,502
to see if it's good start
by swirling it in the glass.

786
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:28,037
Then they smell it.

787
01:03:29,317 --> 01:03:30,445
They taste it.

788
01:03:33,792 --> 01:03:34,522
And spit it out.

789
01:03:35,896 --> 01:03:36,865
That's icky.

790
01:03:36,932 --> 01:03:38,994
Not in the glass usually.

791
01:03:39,169 --> 01:03:40,503
It's very good.

792
01:03:40,873 --> 01:03:42,969
If you don't finish the beans, eat some.

793
01:03:43,177 --> 01:03:44,202
I ate lots already.

794
01:03:44,381 --> 01:03:46,248
Look, eat half what's left.

795
01:03:46,485 --> 01:03:50,016
Next time, the cream cake at 6 o'clock,
forget it.

796
01:03:52,397 --> 01:03:53,422
Come on...

797
01:04:03,217 --> 01:04:04,949
She takes ages to drop off.

798
01:04:05,021 --> 01:04:06,992
If I don't stay, it's even longer.

799
01:04:07,159 --> 01:04:08,561
You weren't bored?

800
01:04:08,896 --> 01:04:09,830
نه
No.

801
01:04:11,435 --> 01:04:14,840
این براش وحشتناکه
 خیلی غیر منتظره ست
It's horrible for her,
this coming out of the blue.

802
01:04:16,210 --> 01:04:17,805
خیلی خوش شانسه که تو رو داره
It's lucky she has you.

803
01:04:19,517 --> 01:04:20,542
میدونی
You know...

804
01:04:21,488 --> 01:04:23,014
نظر لطفته ولی
It's sweet of you,

805
01:04:23,091 --> 01:04:25,962
نمیتونم دیگه اینطوری زندگی کنم
but I can't go on living like this.

806
01:04:27,032 --> 01:04:30,267
یه کم نیاز به سکوت و آرامش نیاز دارم
I need some peace and quiet.

807
01:04:32,109 --> 01:04:34,205
اگر میخوای بیا با من زندگی کن
If you want, move into my place.

808
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:37,547
Take your time to process it all.
It's no problem.

809
01:04:39,189 --> 01:04:41,423
I'll go back to Perigueux with my mother.

810
01:04:43,030 --> 01:04:45,434
You said it's tricky, living with her.

811
01:04:45,603 --> 01:04:46,503
Here, sure.

812
01:04:46,571 --> 01:04:49,042
Down south, we have more space.

813
01:04:49,611 --> 01:04:53,107
I'll pick up with old pupils,
even if I can't play.

814
01:04:53,184 --> 01:04:57,182
Having already worked together makes
it much easier.

815
01:05:01,133 --> 01:05:03,867
You need someone who gives you support.

816
01:05:04,039 --> 01:05:05,532
You need someone who...

817
01:05:06,343 --> 01:05:07,472
Who carries you.

818
01:05:08,181 --> 01:05:11,120
Who's there for both of you, who's reliable.

819
01:05:11,187 --> 01:05:13,181
I'm not that person right now.

820
01:05:15,496 --> 01:05:16,487
Come here.

821
01:06:16,216 --> 01:06:18,050
- Hi, David.
- Hi, Moise.

822
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:20,318
Sorry for your friend but Simonian...

823
01:06:20,391 --> 01:06:21,622
No problem.

824
01:06:22,128 --> 01:06:23,188
When did she leave?

825
01:06:23,364 --> 01:06:24,355
This morning.

826
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:26,160
And the new people?

827
01:06:26,470 --> 01:06:27,565
A Russian couple.

828
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:30,077
- I meet them at the station in 30 minutes.
- OK.

829
01:06:30,378 --> 01:06:31,973
- See you later.
- Bye.

830
01:07:28,795 --> 01:07:30,458
Mr and Mrs Orlov?

831
01:07:31,066 --> 01:07:32,501
Nice to meet you. I'm David.

832
01:07:33,204 --> 01:07:35,300
- A good trip?
- Yes, thank you.

833
01:07:35,642 --> 01:07:37,134
It's this way.

834
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:25,800
Hey there.

835
01:08:26,744 --> 01:08:28,111
How was your day?

836
01:08:33,357 --> 01:08:34,257
Are you ok?

837
01:08:34,694 --> 01:08:35,628
No.

838
01:08:36,230 --> 01:08:38,064
What's wrong? Did I do something?

839
01:08:39,670 --> 01:08:41,435
What's the matter then?

840
01:08:41,506 --> 01:08:42,840
I got punished.

841
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:44,676
Don't worry about it.

842
01:08:45,381 --> 01:08:47,819
I thought it was serious. Who cares!

843
01:08:58,173 --> 01:08:59,837
I don't want to go.

844
01:09:01,213 --> 01:09:03,377
I thought you loved being at Maud's.

845
01:09:03,450 --> 01:09:05,752
Tonight I'd rather stay with you.

846
01:09:05,822 --> 01:09:09,455
You can't keep changing your mind.
It's organised with Maud.

847
01:09:09,529 --> 01:09:11,694
What difference if it's tomorrow?

848
01:09:11,768 --> 01:09:15,105
The difference is it's organised.
And I'm busy tonight.

849
01:09:15,174 --> 01:09:17,543
- How come?
- I'm having dinner with friends.

850
01:09:17,713 --> 01:09:19,809
Why can't I come with you?

851
01:09:19,917 --> 01:09:22,856
Because it's far, it'll be grownups talking.

852
01:09:22,923 --> 01:09:24,449
Because you just can't.

853
01:09:30,739 --> 01:09:32,208
Don't cry like that.

854
01:09:33,477 --> 01:09:34,708
You'll see me tomorrow.

855
01:09:37,518 --> 01:09:40,355
My little lamb chop. Don't cry, please.

856
01:09:53,450 --> 01:09:56,218
Come in. The rabbit's in the living room.

857
01:10:15,594 --> 01:10:17,189
Have fun tonight.

858
01:10:18,768 --> 01:10:20,294
You have fun too.

859
01:10:29,456 --> 01:10:31,723
Do you mind if I tape this?

860
01:10:31,828 --> 01:10:33,765
No, fine, it was agreed.

861
01:10:36,737 --> 01:10:38,867
Where should I begin?

862
01:10:39,709 --> 01:10:40,804
It's up to you.

863
01:10:40,879 --> 01:10:44,546
The idea is to get a firsthand portrait
of your sister.

864
01:10:44,619 --> 01:10:47,752
Without entering into intimate details,
obviously.

865
01:10:51,934 --> 01:10:54,303
It may be easier to begin with her work.

866
01:10:54,372 --> 01:10:56,206
You said she was an English teacher.

867
01:10:56,276 --> 01:10:58,270
At Arago High School.

868
01:10:58,447 --> 01:11:01,819
She loved her job,
although she said it was getting harder

869
01:11:01,988 --> 01:11:03,389
in recent years.

870
01:11:04,459 --> 01:11:06,623
Why did she choose English?

871
01:11:06,797 --> 01:11:08,927
- Our mother's English.
- Really?

872
01:11:09,502 --> 01:11:10,596
That's interesting.

873
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:12,805
She lives in London.

874
01:11:13,010 --> 01:11:15,447
So Sandrine had lived in London also?

875
01:11:15,514 --> 01:11:16,539
No, never.

876
01:11:16,616 --> 01:11:20,387
But she got tickets for Wimbledon
for her daughter and me next week.

877
01:11:20,558 --> 01:11:21,618
She had a daughter?

878
01:11:23,831 --> 01:11:24,764
Yes.

879
01:11:25,034 --> 01:11:27,232
You didn't mention it on the phone.

880
01:11:27,405 --> 01:11:31,278
How is that relevant to a portrait of Sandrine?

881
01:11:32,682 --> 01:11:36,418
Usually, when people have children,
it gets a mention.

882
01:11:36,489 --> 01:11:38,961
I mean, is it your readers' business?

883
01:11:41,566 --> 01:11:43,366
The idea really is to...

884
01:11:44,005 --> 01:11:48,344
To tell the story of these people
who were just like you and me.

885
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:49,843
Who had children...

886
01:11:50,952 --> 01:11:53,480
The children are part of their stories.

887
01:11:55,794 --> 01:11:59,758
I'm sorry. I know you've put in an effort
but we can't go on.

888
01:11:59,837 --> 01:12:01,272
Look, it's...

889
01:12:01,506 --> 01:12:02,874
I understand, it's sensitive.

890
01:12:02,943 --> 01:12:05,005
It's not sensitive. I just changed my mind,

891
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:06,310
sorry.

892
01:12:07,585 --> 01:12:08,987
Leave it, I'll get it.

893
01:12:09,355 --> 01:12:12,021
No, you came down here.

894
01:12:12,094 --> 01:12:13,324
I really do apologise.

895
01:12:13,397 --> 01:12:14,593
No, it's fine.

896
01:12:59,388 --> 01:13:00,049
How are you?

897
01:13:01,961 --> 01:13:03,362
- Shall we go?
- Sure.

898
01:13:03,530 --> 01:13:04,555
See you!

899
01:13:04,832 --> 01:13:05,698
See you!

900
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:10,441
- You enjoyed that?
- Yes.

901
01:13:15,154 --> 01:13:15,952
Thanks.

902
01:13:20,030 --> 01:13:21,055
Arms up.

903
01:13:26,009 --> 01:13:27,501
Remove your shoes, please.

904
01:13:28,814 --> 01:13:29,839
Try again.

905
01:13:33,023 --> 01:13:34,083
You're good.

906
01:13:35,494 --> 01:13:38,365
Aim straight for the hole.

907
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:40,398
Visualise it.

908
01:13:41,739 --> 01:13:43,767
No, not strong enough.

909
01:13:43,844 --> 01:13:45,838
It stresses me out, I don't like it.

910
01:13:46,082 --> 01:13:48,576
Don't stress out. You need to be relaxed.

911
01:13:48,753 --> 01:13:51,487
My stick's bent. It's twisted.

912
01:13:51,559 --> 01:13:52,687
No, it isn't.

913
01:13:53,163 --> 01:13:54,427
Come on!

914
01:13:54,498 --> 01:13:56,901
- It's not like yours.
- It's not bent.

915
01:13:57,171 --> 01:13:59,472
Not like mine? Mine's way bigger.

916
01:13:59,642 --> 01:14:01,613
You want it? It's as big as you.

917
01:14:03,850 --> 01:14:05,912
Hold on, you know what?

918
01:14:06,089 --> 01:14:08,890
I'll move it closer. It's a heck of a way.

919
01:14:09,128 --> 01:14:11,690
There you go. It'll be easier now.

920
01:14:16,476 --> 01:14:18,674
There! You see!

921
01:14:21,152 --> 01:14:23,680
Just shows. Nice and relaxed.

922
01:14:24,125 --> 01:14:26,596
Sure, but it was closer, too.

923
01:14:27,031 --> 01:14:28,933
It was closer but so what?

924
01:14:35,714 --> 01:14:37,446
What are they arguing about?

925
01:14:38,853 --> 01:14:40,824
Is it because of her clothes?

926
01:14:41,025 --> 01:14:42,722
Yes, looks that way.

927
01:14:43,663 --> 01:14:45,793
Why don't we believe in God?

928
01:14:47,037 --> 01:14:48,062
We just don't.

929
01:14:48,206 --> 01:14:51,737
At school, they say I'll burn in hell
if I don't believe in God.

930
01:14:51,913 --> 01:14:53,975
That's absolute nonsense.

931
01:14:55,887 --> 01:14:57,482
Does hell exist?

932
01:14:57,691 --> 01:14:59,889
No, it doesn't, it's bullshit.

933
01:15:00,063 --> 01:15:02,591
I mean, believers believe in it but...

934
01:15:03,103 --> 01:15:05,665
They don't actually know. Nobody knows.

935
01:15:05,841 --> 01:15:08,837
So if it's true, you don't know either.

936
01:15:08,913 --> 01:15:10,850
Could be, it exists.

937
01:15:10,951 --> 01:15:12,444
One thing's for sure...

938
01:15:12,621 --> 01:15:14,057
Those kids at school

939
01:15:14,492 --> 01:15:16,929
are only repeating what their parents say.

940
01:15:17,031 --> 01:15:19,468
They have no right to scare you, ok?

941
01:15:21,739 --> 01:15:25,475
Next time they say that,
tell them I'll kick their behinds!

942
01:15:27,551 --> 01:15:28,952
Ok, hard right!

943
01:15:29,288 --> 01:15:31,521
Not right away.

944
01:15:31,859 --> 01:15:32,828
But...

945
01:15:32,895 --> 01:15:35,493
I'm just putting you straight, come on!

946
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:37,227
I'm not the driver, you are.

947
01:15:37,638 --> 01:15:39,575
- Watch out! Leaves!
- Which way?

948
01:15:39,642 --> 01:15:40,975
There. Turn right.

949
01:15:45,954 --> 01:15:48,483
- I can do it now.
- Straight ahead.

950
01:15:49,528 --> 01:15:51,897
Were you really a tennis champion before?

951
01:15:52,534 --> 01:15:53,662
No.

952
01:15:54,939 --> 01:15:57,741
Not a champion, no, but I was...

953
01:15:58,780 --> 01:16:01,844
One day, Mummy showed me
a film of you two young.

954
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:03,947
You were playing tennis and everything.

955
01:16:04,023 --> 01:16:05,584
- Really?
- Yes.

956
01:16:07,097 --> 01:16:09,659
Our father...

957
01:16:09,735 --> 01:16:12,708
Your grandfather was always making home movies.

958
01:16:14,812 --> 01:16:16,042
I didn't know that.

959
01:16:45,140 --> 01:16:47,134
- More wine?
- Sure.

960
01:16:49,748 --> 01:16:50,307
Thanks.

961
01:16:50,383 --> 01:16:51,977
Time for bed, Amanda.

962
01:16:52,321 --> 01:16:53,654
Not just yet.

963
01:16:53,723 --> 01:16:55,626
It's getting late.

964
01:16:56,596 --> 01:16:58,328
Take Caramel with you, if you want.

965
01:16:58,399 --> 01:16:59,663
Caramel!

966
01:17:00,704 --> 01:17:01,968
It's the name we gave him.

967
01:17:02,039 --> 01:17:03,566
It's a white rabbit.

968
01:17:04,077 --> 01:17:06,345
We have more imagination than you.

969
01:17:09,288 --> 01:17:10,348
Taste this.

970
01:17:11,359 --> 01:17:14,024
I kept it from the restaurant we had in Clichy.

971
01:17:15,934 --> 01:17:18,372
Everyone's trying to get me off my head.

972
01:17:19,341 --> 01:17:21,072
No chance with that.

973
01:17:21,145 --> 01:17:23,844
It's made from brambleberries.

974
01:17:25,186 --> 01:17:26,280
Goes down a treat.

975
01:17:30,964 --> 01:17:32,798
Did you know our mother well?

976
01:17:34,872 --> 01:17:37,674
See? Not so bad after all, my berry brandy.

977
01:17:39,415 --> 01:17:40,782
Funny you should ask.

978
01:17:40,850 --> 01:17:44,723
I was thinking of Alison only a few days ago.

979
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:48,626
We saw a lot of each other in the early days.

980
01:17:48,700 --> 01:17:49,896
We got on well.

981
01:17:50,337 --> 01:17:52,774
There was something free about her.

982
01:17:52,841 --> 01:17:54,277
Very open-minded.

983
01:17:56,147 --> 01:17:58,244
For me, the shy introvert back then,

984
01:17:58,419 --> 01:18:01,290
meeting your mother was very beneficial.

985
01:18:02,828 --> 01:18:04,355
And when she left him,

986
01:18:04,431 --> 01:18:07,199
Luc was crushed, of course.

987
01:18:08,373 --> 01:18:11,312
He wouldn't let anyone say her name even.

988
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:13,343
He never talked about her?

989
01:18:13,716 --> 01:18:16,712
Hardly ever. I have some memories of her.

990
01:18:16,956 --> 01:18:20,362
But mostly after she left,
and that didn't last long.

991
01:18:20,430 --> 01:18:24,394
Whenever we asked Dad,
he said she'd broken off all ties.

992
01:18:24,938 --> 01:18:28,674
She had a new life
and there was no room for us in it.

993
01:18:28,746 --> 01:18:30,717
He wasn't completely wrong.

994
01:18:31,285 --> 01:18:35,420
Alison wears her heart on her sleeve.
She's very impulsive.

995
01:18:35,794 --> 01:18:38,824
She was soon in another serious relationship.

996
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:41,930
Nothing happened without your father organising.

997
01:18:42,006 --> 01:18:44,911
Did you still see her around that time?

998
01:18:44,978 --> 01:18:48,817
She wrote occasionally,
asking after you two mostly.

999
01:18:49,488 --> 01:18:51,185
When Luc found out,

1000
01:18:51,892 --> 01:18:54,056
he flipped his lid, threatened us...

1001
01:18:54,130 --> 01:18:57,298
Or kind of told us to choose sides.

1002
01:18:58,739 --> 01:19:01,233
I must have her letters somewhere.

1003
01:19:01,479 --> 01:19:03,473
Assuming you want to see them.

1004
01:19:04,016 --> 01:19:04,950
Sure.

1005
01:19:18,346 --> 01:19:20,248
- Here.
- Thanks.

1006
01:19:21,519 --> 01:19:24,492
When your father died,
I thought about contacting her.

1007
01:19:25,527 --> 01:19:29,434
I know she found out from a mutual friend.

1008
01:19:30,035 --> 01:19:32,769
I didn't do it. Time had gone by.

1009
01:19:33,509 --> 01:19:35,742
Anyway, you know...

1010
01:20:20,803 --> 01:20:22,967
Hi, David, this is Lena.

1011
01:20:23,208 --> 01:20:25,806
It's late. I hope I don't wake you.

1012
01:20:26,482 --> 01:20:29,455
I received the little electronic
keyboard you sent.

1013
01:20:29,821 --> 01:20:32,384
I played it with my good hand.

1014
01:20:32,927 --> 01:20:35,399
I even recorded a song on my phone.

1015
01:20:37,169 --> 01:20:39,299
You and Amanda are in my thoughts.

1016
01:20:39,941 --> 01:20:42,037
Words can't express how much I think of you,

1017
01:20:42,112 --> 01:20:43,308
my distant friends.

1018
01:21:14,478 --> 01:21:15,606
Excuse me!

1019
01:21:17,349 --> 01:21:18,619
Can I help you?

1020
01:21:18,619 --> 01:21:21,090
Hello, are you Lena's mother?

1021
01:21:21,257 --> 01:21:22,852
- Yes.
- I'm David, a friend.

1022
01:21:22,927 --> 01:21:24,123
I've come to say hi.

1023
01:21:24,263 --> 01:21:26,234
Come up, I'll call her.

1024
01:21:26,300 --> 01:21:27,132
Thanks.

1025
01:21:38,391 --> 01:21:39,325
Hey.

1026
01:21:39,628 --> 01:21:41,291
I was in the area so...

1027
01:21:43,234 --> 01:21:44,966
You never listen, do you?

1028
01:21:45,138 --> 01:21:46,163
I don't want to intrude.

1029
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:48,508
I can come back later or not at all.

1030
01:21:53,956 --> 01:21:56,052
It's funny imagining you here.

1031
01:21:56,327 --> 01:21:59,495
I've spent so long living in cities,
only cities.

1032
01:22:00,937 --> 01:22:01,928
So here we are,

1033
01:22:02,105 --> 01:22:03,871
town mouse and country mouse.

1034
01:22:04,611 --> 01:22:05,580
Marvellous.

1035
01:22:07,282 --> 01:22:08,616
You remember that?

1036
01:22:10,590 --> 01:22:13,529
Once upon a time,
town mouse invited country mouse

1037
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:17,164
most courteously
to share leftovers of ortolan...

1038
01:22:17,637 --> 01:22:19,004
You still know it.

1039
01:22:19,674 --> 01:22:21,337
What's an ortolan by the way?

1040
01:22:22,212 --> 01:22:23,237
A bird.

1041
01:22:24,951 --> 01:22:26,581
- Really?
- Yes.

1042
01:22:27,389 --> 01:22:29,087
You really are a town mouse.

1043
01:22:35,473 --> 01:22:36,942
Tell me about Amanda.

1044
01:22:39,547 --> 01:22:41,643
It's difficult to know how she's doing.

1045
01:22:42,286 --> 01:22:43,620
She's strong.

1046
01:22:43,956 --> 01:22:45,289
She amazes me.

1047
01:22:45,726 --> 01:22:48,129
Often it's as if she's there for me.

1048
01:22:49,433 --> 01:22:50,926
I think of her a lot.

1049
01:22:51,672 --> 01:22:53,369
She asked about you, too.

1050
01:22:53,475 --> 01:22:54,944
- Really?
- Yes.

1051
01:22:55,011 --> 01:22:57,209
Her piano lessons mean a lot to her.

1052
01:23:03,061 --> 01:23:04,929
I'm going to start the process.

1053
01:23:06,067 --> 01:23:07,331
I'll look after her.

1054
01:23:08,539 --> 01:23:10,168
Take care of her.

1055
01:23:10,543 --> 01:23:12,342
I'll be her guardian.

1056
01:23:15,185 --> 01:23:16,985
I think I'll adopt her, too.

1057
01:23:25,271 --> 01:23:27,242
I came to take you back to Paris.

1058
01:23:28,712 --> 01:23:31,685
I never asked anyone this
and never thought I would.

1059
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:34,114
I'm really touched

1060
01:23:34,289 --> 01:23:36,021
but we hardly know each other.

1061
01:23:36,227 --> 01:23:38,095
I know it might seem absurd

1062
01:23:38,164 --> 01:23:39,258
and you're right,

1063
01:23:39,333 --> 01:23:41,327
this must be our fourth time out together.

1064
01:23:41,504 --> 01:23:43,168
I'm not crazy, honestly.

1065
01:23:43,441 --> 01:23:46,677
When I had to decide about Amanda,
thinking of you helped me.

1066
01:23:47,082 --> 01:23:48,051
Precisely.

1067
01:23:48,484 --> 01:23:51,389
Amanda needs you. She needs peace and quiet.

1068
01:23:52,059 --> 01:23:53,119
We have time.

1069
01:23:53,327 --> 01:23:55,595
How can you think we have time?

1070
01:23:55,666 --> 01:23:57,260
Seriously, David.

1071
01:23:57,469 --> 01:23:59,463
We have all the time in the world now.

1072
01:24:10,796 --> 01:24:12,630
Do you want to stay with me tonight?

1073
01:25:00,796 --> 01:25:02,356
David, I'm Ivan.

1074
01:25:02,532 --> 01:25:04,366
I guess Sandrine mentioned me.

1075
01:25:04,536 --> 01:25:07,099
I wanted to write rather than call.

1076
01:25:07,275 --> 01:25:09,075
I'm more comfortable writing.

1077
01:25:09,513 --> 01:25:10,676
I don't know if you want to

1078
01:25:10,749 --> 01:25:12,446
but I'd like us to meet.

1079
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:14,716
Sandrine told me about her little bro.

1080
01:25:14,791 --> 01:25:16,625
It's dumb we never met.

1081
01:25:16,795 --> 01:25:18,663
Apparently, we have lots in common.

1082
01:25:19,566 --> 01:25:22,505
Looking forward to hearing from you, Ivan.

1083
01:27:08,852 --> 01:27:11,449
Is it like the cars, wrong way round?

1084
01:27:12,525 --> 01:27:14,428
More like we got the wrong keys.

1085
01:27:14,764 --> 01:27:16,256
Now we're in the shit.

1086
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:17,591
Can I try?

1087
01:27:26,955 --> 01:27:28,185
Thanks.

1088
01:27:28,257 --> 01:27:30,694
It's not supposed to be like the cars.

1089
01:27:31,764 --> 01:27:33,734
It'll do us good to kick back.

1090
01:27:34,603 --> 01:27:35,766
Nice place, isn't it?

1091
01:27:36,340 --> 01:27:37,536
It looks old.

1092
01:27:37,776 --> 01:27:38,904
Yeah, it does.

1093
01:27:39,513 --> 01:27:42,543
Go on up and choose which bedroom you want.

1094
01:28:34,824 --> 01:28:36,384
She must be there.

1095
01:28:36,493 --> 01:28:37,462
What?

1096
01:28:37,662 --> 01:28:40,794
I heard something about a beached whale.

1097
01:28:40,969 --> 01:28:42,598
They got her back in the water

1098
01:28:42,672 --> 01:28:44,768
but she hangs around here.

1099
01:28:45,311 --> 01:28:47,407
Apparently she pops up now and then.

1100
01:28:47,482 --> 01:28:48,451
Here.

1101
01:28:51,023 --> 01:28:52,014
Let's see.

1102
01:29:08,090 --> 01:29:09,753
What did he say?

1103
01:29:10,561 --> 01:29:12,395
Apparently she was here 10 minutes ago.

1104
01:29:20,815 --> 01:29:23,378
How old will you be when I'm your age?

1105
01:29:23,454 --> 01:29:24,890
Really old?

1106
01:29:24,957 --> 01:29:27,326
Really old with a long, white beard.

1107
01:29:28,898 --> 01:29:30,367
No, honestly?

1108
01:29:30,701 --> 01:29:32,672
When you're my age, I'll be 40.

1109
01:29:32,906 --> 01:29:34,637
40 isn't very old.

1110
01:29:34,809 --> 01:29:36,473
No, it's not very old.

1111
01:29:36,813 --> 01:29:38,807
So you'll still look after me?

1112
01:29:39,018 --> 01:29:39,952
Sure.

1113
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:45,058
How long will you be with me?

1114
01:29:45,431 --> 01:29:47,595
I'm with you at least until you're 18.

1115
01:29:48,938 --> 01:29:49,907
Every day?

1116
01:29:50,641 --> 01:29:51,701
Every day.

1117
01:29:55,751 --> 01:29:57,551
So you're ok with staying?

1118
01:29:57,923 --> 01:29:59,586
We'll put up with each other?

1119
01:29:59,859 --> 01:30:00,920
We'll see.

1120
01:30:23,073 --> 01:30:24,007
Hello.

1121
01:30:25,077 --> 01:30:26,410
Alison?

1122
01:30:27,682 --> 01:30:31,555
Yes, at the top of the slope near some trees.

1123
01:30:32,658 --> 01:30:33,490
Yes.

1124
01:30:40,441 --> 01:30:41,876
- Hi.
- Hi.

1125
01:30:42,612 --> 01:30:43,911
Hello, David.

1126
01:30:53,767 --> 01:30:55,431
Thanks for coming.

1127
01:30:55,537 --> 01:30:56,733
Yeah, it's...

1128
01:31:00,481 --> 01:31:01,711
Shall we sit down?

1129
01:31:09,232 --> 01:31:11,203
So, do you live locally?

1130
01:31:12,038 --> 01:31:15,102
No, a little further west of here.

1131
01:31:15,177 --> 01:31:17,080
Just after Bayswater.

1132
01:31:17,815 --> 01:31:21,153
I thought about suggesting you pop round but...

1133
01:31:21,556 --> 01:31:23,994
No, the park's just fine.

1134
01:31:26,967 --> 01:31:29,098
- You arrived this morning?
- Yes.

1135
01:31:29,839 --> 01:31:31,867
We're staying in South Wimbledon.

1136
01:31:32,578 --> 01:31:33,774
Quite a trot.

1137
01:31:33,847 --> 01:31:36,877
We came for the championships,
so it's practical.

1138
01:31:38,991 --> 01:31:40,962
Sandrine wrote to tell me

1139
01:31:41,963 --> 01:31:44,526
that you were all going this year.

1140
01:31:45,004 --> 01:31:47,202
She talked about this trip.

1141
01:31:47,842 --> 01:31:50,076
We discussed possibly meeting up.

1142
01:31:50,214 --> 01:31:51,808
She told me, yes.

1143
01:31:52,051 --> 01:31:55,513
I know it mattered to her,
especially you meeting Amanda.

1144
01:31:59,966 --> 01:32:01,766
Can we talk about you?

1145
01:32:02,171 --> 01:32:03,162
Yeah.

1146
01:32:03,273 --> 01:32:04,503
Sure.

1147
01:32:06,813 --> 01:32:07,941
Well then...

1148
01:32:08,550 --> 01:32:10,748
What are you doing right now?

1149
01:32:10,854 --> 01:32:13,588
- For a living?
- I'm in arborism.

1150
01:32:14,162 --> 01:32:16,497
In trees, trimming branches.

1151
01:32:17,068 --> 01:32:17,967
I see.

1152
01:32:21,743 --> 01:32:23,646
- And you?
- Me?

1153
01:32:23,980 --> 01:32:28,889
I spent a long time working
as deputy curator of a museum.

1154
01:32:28,957 --> 01:32:30,621
In Hampstead Heath.

1155
01:32:30,694 --> 01:32:33,531
Since it closed down a few years ago,

1156
01:32:33,700 --> 01:32:36,035
I give French lessons.

1157
01:32:46,024 --> 01:32:47,015
David.

1158
01:32:47,828 --> 01:32:50,096
It will take a lot of time

1159
01:32:50,934 --> 01:32:54,102
for us to be able to really talk.

1160
01:32:54,842 --> 01:32:57,610
For me to be able to...

1161
01:32:57,948 --> 01:32:59,816
To explain to you...

1162
01:32:59,886 --> 01:33:02,586
Try to explain to you...

1163
01:33:04,562 --> 01:33:07,694
I know it must feel strange,

1164
01:33:07,768 --> 01:33:10,639
perhaps even intolerable

1165
01:33:10,807 --> 01:33:12,903
to hear this but...

1166
01:33:15,751 --> 01:33:19,157
I also came here to tell you

1167
01:33:19,592 --> 01:33:21,187
I'm there for you both.

1168
01:33:21,362 --> 01:33:22,695
For you

1169
01:33:23,099 --> 01:33:24,295
and Amanda.

1170
01:33:25,370 --> 01:33:27,341
If you ever

1171
01:33:28,210 --> 01:33:30,238
want one day to...

1172
01:33:39,732 --> 01:33:40,564
Amanda.

1173
01:33:41,236 --> 01:33:44,801
This is Alison, who I told you about.
Mummy's mother.

1174
01:33:47,281 --> 01:33:51,780
- Hi.
- I'm really delighted to meet you.

1175
01:33:51,856 --> 01:33:52,950
Truly.

1176
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:54,991
Thanks for coming.

1177
01:33:58,770 --> 01:34:00,263
You're very beautiful.

1178
01:34:03,813 --> 01:34:05,374
If you still have time,

1179
01:34:05,450 --> 01:34:08,081
we could get an ice cream.

1180
01:34:08,390 --> 01:34:13,059
There's an ice cream shop nearby.
They're really good.

1181
01:34:13,300 --> 01:34:14,269
Want one?

1182
01:34:43,193 --> 01:34:44,958
I like our street.

1183
01:34:45,297 --> 01:34:46,698
Pretty, isn't it?

1184
01:34:47,968 --> 01:34:50,098
Early start to see the matches.

1185
01:34:50,172 --> 01:34:51,642
We'll watch on Centre Court.

1186
01:34:51,709 --> 01:34:53,680
You bet we will.

1187
01:34:57,788 --> 01:34:59,189
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

1188
01:35:01,696 --> 01:35:03,223
Alison's nice.

1189
01:35:03,433 --> 01:35:04,800
You think?

1190
01:35:05,069 --> 01:35:07,199
Great. She enjoyed meeting you.

1191
01:35:07,741 --> 01:35:08,835
You know, I think

1192
01:35:08,910 --> 01:35:11,883
Sandrine would be pleased to know you two met.

1193
01:35:11,983 --> 01:35:12,974
Really?

1194
01:35:14,922 --> 01:35:17,952
If Alison is Mummy's mummy, she's yours too.

1195
01:35:18,028 --> 01:35:20,330
- You have the same one?
- Sure.

1196
01:35:20,467 --> 01:35:22,335
I hardly knew her, hardly know her

1197
01:35:22,404 --> 01:35:24,341
but she's my mother too.

1198
01:35:41,843 --> 01:35:44,406
Hope you both had a great day,
not too gruelling.

1199
01:35:44,782 --> 01:35:47,219
I'll be watching on TV to see if I can see you.

1200
01:35:47,387 --> 01:35:50,258
Can't wait to be with you again,
my handsome David.

1201
01:35:50,427 --> 01:35:51,919
I miss you. Lena.

1202
01:39:26,224 --> 01:39:27,193
What?

1203
01:39:31,735 --> 01:39:32,635
It's done.

1204
01:39:33,004 --> 01:39:34,064
It's over.

1205
01:39:34,240 --> 01:39:36,474
Hold on, it isn't over yet.

1206
01:39:37,112 --> 01:39:38,946
He's only three points down.

1207
01:39:41,154 --> 01:39:43,558
What's wrong? Why are you crying?

1208
01:39:44,060 --> 01:39:45,120
What's the matter?

1209
01:39:48,970 --> 01:39:50,964
Stop. I don't like to see you unhappy.

1210
01:39:52,577 --> 01:39:54,479
What's wrong, lamb chop?

1211
01:40:17,560 --> 01:40:18,529
You see?

1212
01:40:18,729 --> 01:40:20,164
It's not over.

1213
01:40:47,286 --> 01:40:48,654
You see now?

1214
01:40:49,523 --> 01:40:51,654
Hang in there all the way.
