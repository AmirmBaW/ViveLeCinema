Curry,
you're fifteen minutes late.

15
00:02:53,983 --> 00:02:56,322
Well, I got fifteen
minutes of problems, Ok?

16
00:02:56,522 --> 00:02:59,384
- Hey, whats going on?
- The problem is you're late, smart ass.

17
00:02:59,584 --> 00:03:01,046
Morning, Neil. Morning, Jeff.

18
00:03:01,246 --> 00:03:02,028
- Coffee.

19
00:03:02,228 --> 00:03:05,190
- Coffee black, right?
- I wanna one of those beef potato burritos.

20
00:03:05,356 --> 00:03:08,218
No, I think you'd much
rather have yogourt.

21
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,429
Much better for you.
Here you go, Jeff.

22
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:15,191
Here you go.

23
00:03:15,391 --> 00:03:19,183
Hey, I hate to break up this coffee
klatch, but we got work to do.

24
00:03:19,346 --> 00:03:21,337
Now, if you don't want to work,
you keep this up, smart ass.

25
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:25,513
You and funny man follow me out to lot
number nine. Now come on, let's move.

26
00:04:18,288 --> 00:04:19,958
Hello?

27
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:23,428
Hello? Is anyone there?

28
00:04:26,716 --> 00:04:28,443
Hello?

29
00:04:37,841 --> 00:04:41,061
If you tried and
failed at trying.

30
00:04:44,377 --> 00:04:48,000
Hear you played
a losing game.

31
00:04:51,318 --> 00:04:54,548
Yes, you tried and
failed at trying.

32
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,369
Hear you played
a losing game.

33
00:05:04,597 --> 00:05:10,130
Ah, if you need a
friend to call on, yes.

34
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,833
Remember my name.

35
00:05:43,054 --> 00:05:47,008
This way, ladies. Oh, I know they're
going to look wonderful on you.

36
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,588
Let's see, this is thirteen.

37
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,435
Yes, can I help you, miss?
Anything you want?

38
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,531
Just looking.

39
00:06:25,741 --> 00:06:26,947
I want it to fit right.

40
00:06:27,147 --> 00:06:29,097
You look wonderful.

41
00:06:29,297 --> 00:06:31,137
Yeah. Does it fit right?

42
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:34,250
Well, I think maybe you can pull it in
your waist a little bit and show your...

43
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,429
My husband likes me in
loose-fitting clothes.

44
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:40,404
In that case we have this wonderful
kimono here. Look at the beautiful colours.

45
00:06:40,604 --> 00:06:46,673
That would look great with it, and at night you
can put up your hair. Doesn't that look great?

46
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:48,775
- That's just lovely.
- I'll take it.

47
00:06:48,851 --> 00:06:51,386
Wonderful.
Will this be cash or charge?

48
00:06:51,586 --> 00:06:52,865
Where did you
get your shoes?

49
00:06:53,065 --> 00:06:54,859
- Oh, downstairs.
- It'll be cash.

50
00:06:55,059 --> 00:06:56,235
Ok, fine.

51
00:06:56,435 --> 00:06:59,410
And wrap it up as a present,
Ok?

52
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:25,922
When's Matt coming home?

53
00:07:26,122 --> 00:07:28,587
Well, he's on the road a lot.

54
00:07:38,877 --> 00:07:41,427
Hi. You the man around here?

couple of lamps for my place. Ok?

57
00:07:55,594 --> 00:07:57,104
So, you got a name?

58
00:07:57,304 --> 00:07:59,124
Yeah, Pike.

59
00:08:00,066 --> 00:08:02,446
Well, Mr. Pike,
I love music too.

60
00:08:02,646 --> 00:08:05,111
It's not Mr. Pike, just Pike.

61
00:08:05,335 --> 00:08:08,487
Will you please get
out of my place?

62
00:08:08,687 --> 00:08:12,917

00:09:19,028 --> 00:09:21,089
- Hello?
- Honey who is it?

76
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,855
It's Neil.

77
00:09:23,055 --> 00:09:24,749
Look uh.

78
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:28,428
I think I should stick around here and
talk to Jeff. He's in pretty bad shape.

79
00:09:28,628 --> 00:09:30,203
<i>When do you think
you'll be coming over?</i>

80
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,109
Oh, in about an hour,
an hour and a half.

81
00:09:33,309 --> 00:09:37,317
<i>It's something I just have to do, you know?
I'll be there in less than two hours, Ok?</i>

82
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:39,931
Ok, bye.

83
00:09:41,939 --> 00:09:43,095
Is Neil coming over?

84
00:09:43,295 --> 00:09:44,852
In a couple of hours.

85
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:46,608
A couple of hours?

86
00:09:46,808 --> 00:09:51,483
Honey, is there anything
wrong between you and Neil?

87
00:10:51,267 --> 00:10:54,035
I didn't cry when
you disappeared.

88
00:11:00,155 --> 00:11:03,130
I didn't cry when
you disappeared.

89
00:11:04,015 --> 00:11:06,140
I was worried about you.

90
00:11:07,514 --> 00:11:11,679
But I figured that you
had to do your own... shit!

91
00:11:16,535 --> 00:11:18,660
I was worried about you.

92
00:11:23,896 --> 00:11:25,971
But I figured.

93
00:11:27,378 --> 00:11:29,345
Good night.

94
00:11:33,729 --> 00:11:35,950
So, how's Jeff?

- Neil?
- Yeah?

97
00:12:02,995 --> 00:12:05,160
Are things all
right with us?

98
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,100
Have you ever noticed, every time you spend time
with your folks that the first kind of questions...

99
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:11,640
Neil, I want to know if there
are problems between us.

100
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:14,270
You haven't been
happy in a while.

101
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:19,655
I got problems in my life
shortcut, but not they're not you.

102
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:26,689
Hey, you want to go somewhere
and grab a hamburger? Huh?

137
00:16:55,804 --> 00:16:56,980
It belongs on 11.

138
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,745
Oh, shit.

139
00:16:59,242 --> 00:17:00,848

- Cop says he's here.
- Well, he's busy.

155

I have an appointment.
Is this the way?

Did Shirley tell you that I
didn't really need anybody?

167
00:18:29,465 --> 00:18:31,673
Your mother promised me
that you'd have a job for me.

168
00:18:31,873 --> 00:18:32,426
She promised.

169
00:18:32,626 --> 00:18:36,204
Well, I want you to know that I
don't really need anybody here,

170
00:18:36,404 --> 00:18:38,249
but I'll give
you a job anyway.

171
00:18:38,449 --> 00:18:40,579
Now, I have a speech that make
to all of Shirley's friends.

172
00:18:40,779 --> 00:18:41,933
You have a great mother.

173
00:18:42,133 --> 00:18:43,813
Yeah, I know but I
have a speech anyway.

174
00:18:44,013 --> 00:18:47,183
I take you people on, no
questions or discrimination.

175
00:18:47,383 --> 00:18:49,159
You work for me
and we start even.

176
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:54,794
If I find shortages, cash or merchandise,
and I don't know who it is, I fire you.

177
00:18:54,994 --> 00:18:59,414
That's my policy and that's
the last I'll mention it.

178
00:19:02,597 --> 00:19:05,770
Shirley said they taught you
how to work a cash register.

179
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:08,775
I can do cash
and credit cards.

180
00:19:10,413 --> 00:19:11,371
Then that's where you start.

181
00:19:11,571 --> 00:19:17,351
Best to learn about anything is
to know how much it costs, right?

182
00:19:18,447 --> 00:19:20,984
- How is she?
- Who?

183
00:19:21,584 --> 00:19:23,319
My mother.

184
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:27,731
Oh, she's great. She has her own
shower now and no work details.

185
00:19:27,931 --> 00:19:31,076
No work details?
She's not working?

186
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,031
Rita.

187
00:19:37,632 --> 00:19:39,133
Rita, this is Emily.
I just hired her.

188
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:42,574
Well put her on checkout for a week, see
how she does. Tell Harry to work in the back.

189
00:19:42,774 --> 00:19:46,208
That's no problem. I'm
getting pretty tired of this.

190
00:19:46,408 --> 00:19:49,013
You're a friend of Shirley's,
aren't you?

191
00:19:49,213 --> 00:19:51,537
Shirley's got a
lot of friends.

192
00:19:51,737 --> 00:19:55,016
Somehow, they all
seem to wind up here.

193
00:19:55,216 --> 00:19:59,089
You know, the last one of Shirley's
friends didn't last too long.

194
00:19:59,289 --> 00:20:02,523
Ok, let's go, Harry. Mr. Nudd
wants you in the back for a week.

195
00:20:02,688 --> 00:20:04,360
This ones taking
over your job.

196
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,661
- Hello.
- Hello.

197
00:20:05,861 --> 00:20:07,272
Well, I'm glad there's a
little class up front.

198
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:10,508
Ok. Thank you, Harry.
This is a cash register.

199
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:12,626
This is cash.

200
00:20:12,826 --> 00:20:14,571
Keep track of all
your accidents.

201
00:20:14,771 --> 00:20:16,845
- Accidents?
- We don't smoke up front.

202
00:20:17,045 --> 00:20:19,026
Yeah,
like that one you got on.

203
00:20:19,226 --> 00:20:21,815
Oo, I bet you took this job
for the guys, didn't you?

204
00:20:22,015 --> 00:20:25,448
Well, you know, the guys who come
in here don't like girls in uniform.

205
00:20:25,622 --> 00:20:27,390
We don't smoke up front.

206
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:30,002
Be polite and
get out of my way.

207
00:20:30,202 --> 00:20:31,988
Get out of my way.

208
00:20:32,188 --> 00:20:35,158
Maybe I should tell Mr. Nudd
that you're a trouble maker.

209
00:20:35,358 --> 00:20:37,292
Did I forget my pen?
Here, look, we're probably not...

210
00:20:37,492 --> 00:20:40,722
- Can you get me a butt can?
- Harry?

211
00:20:46,435 --> 00:20:48,409
Ow, fuck! Shit.

212
00:23:51,534 --> 00:23:53,439
Here you go.

213
00:23:57,912 --> 00:24:00,207
Thanks for the ride, girl.

214
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:02,119
Wanna come in for a while?

215
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:04,398
Neil and I might get the
Ok for our cabin tonight.

216
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:08,198
Oh, no thanks.
Oh, your favourite.

217
00:24:10,545 --> 00:24:11,730
Did you steal these?

218
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:14,334
I told you, this is not stealing.

219
00:24:14,469 --> 00:24:17,771
With the salary we make it's
called getting even. See you, baby.

220
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,915
Gotcha, thanks.

221
00:24:34,691 --> 00:24:35,268
What's wrong, Barbara?

222
00:24:35,468 --> 00:24:36,805
I want to see you.

223
00:24:37,005 --> 00:24:38,817
What happened?

224
00:24:39,017 --> 00:24:41,312
When are you coming home?

225
00:24:42,874 --> 00:24:46,965
It's going to be kind of late tonight, honey,
some guys hate their families, you know.

226
00:24:47,165 --> 00:24:48,605
Yeah. Maybe I'll drive out?

227
00:24:48,805 --> 00:24:50,780
Ok.

228
00:25:29,051 --> 00:25:31,431
What the hell is going on?

229
00:25:33,222 --> 00:25:41,022
Hey, Bar? Bar? Barbara?
What's the matter.

230
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:43,928
I don't know.
Somebody ripped up my garden.

231
00:25:44,128 --> 00:25:46,308
I found these here and
now my car wont start.

232
00:25:46,508 --> 00:25:48,634
Wait a minute.

233
00:25:50,057 --> 00:25:55,072
You know I took that course
last year in auto mechanics.

234
00:25:55,491 --> 00:25:57,994
Let me see.
I think it's your coil wire.

235
00:25:58,194 --> 00:26:00,544
Try to start it up now, baby.

236
00:26:43,651 --> 00:26:49,006
You ever get this thing where
you just want to kill somebody.

237
00:26:49,405 --> 00:26:50,715
Neil.

238
00:26:53,045 --> 00:26:54,308
Come here,
let me show you something.

239
00:26:54,508 --> 00:26:56,845
- Hi, Jeff.
- Babs.

240
00:27:02,188 --> 00:27:04,331
Dig these.

241
00:27:10,102 --> 00:27:12,148
Oh, Neil.

242
00:27:12,348 --> 00:27:14,600
Oh, Neil, it's gorgeous.

243
00:27:15,942 --> 00:27:17,988
Are we going to have the little
stained-glass window here?

244
00:27:18,188 --> 00:27:20,028
And is this the patio?

245
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,700
Oh, it's just gorgeous, Neil.

246
00:27:24,828 --> 00:27:27,417
It's beautiful.

247
00:27:28,005 --> 00:27:29,508
Really, it's terrific.

248
00:27:29,708 --> 00:27:32,011
Hey, let's go somewhere and
really groove over these things.

249
00:27:32,171 --> 00:27:34,331
I'll follow you.

250
00:27:36,817 --> 00:27:38,697
I love you.

251
00:28:06,365 --> 00:28:08,005
You shouldn't let
me drink so much.

252
00:28:08,205 --> 00:28:08,820
You're not drunk.

253
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,411
Let's get this door
fixed, Honeybunch.

254
00:28:11,611 --> 00:28:13,996
I'll fix it tomorrow.

255
00:28:15,948 --> 00:28:21,728
They're laying brick tomorrow, I
don't have to be at work till noon.

256
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,594
Gallons.

257
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,521
You're not my idea of drunken.

258
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:08,320
Hey, come here.

259
00:29:10,428 --> 00:29:12,248
Come here!

260
00:29:24,348 --> 00:29:25,565
Get back in the house,
Barbara.

261
00:29:25,765 --> 00:29:27,445
Who was it?

262
00:29:27,645 --> 00:29:32,320
What do you mean, who was it?
I don't know who it was.

263
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:48,382
You know we don't have any tape
or garbage bags or anything.

264
00:29:48,582 --> 00:29:50,737
Why didn't you tell me
about the garden earlier?

265
00:29:50,897 --> 00:29:52,114
Should we call the police?

266
00:29:52,314 --> 00:29:53,634
I don't want to deal
with the police.

267
00:29:53,734 --> 00:29:54,931
I don't want
anybody to get hurt.

268
00:29:54,931 --> 00:29:57,481
Nobody's getting hurt, Barbara.

269
00:29:58,217 --> 00:30:00,547
What did you do?

270
00:30:01,977 --> 00:30:03,742
Come on.

271
00:30:04,194 --> 00:30:06,489
Nobody's getting hurt, Ok?

272
00:30:52,971 --> 00:30:57,948
<i>I'm worried now, but I
wont be worried long</i>

273
00:30:58,148 --> 00:30:59,320
Hi, can I come in?

274
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,394
I'm going to work.

275
00:31:01,594 --> 00:31:04,569
I'll only stay a few minutes, Ok?

276
00:31:05,628 --> 00:31:07,451
Hey, Pike,

277
00:31:08,717 --> 00:31:10,771
That mirror's really great.

278
00:31:10,971 --> 00:31:13,266
It's exactly what I wanted.

279
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,920
Oh. So,
you've got a girl, hmmm.

280
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,920
I don't bother you.
I expect the same.

281
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:26,577
I don't want to bother you.
Just wanna be friendly and talk.

282
00:31:26,777 --> 00:31:29,577
I don't talk to nobody.
I listen.

283
00:31:30,605 --> 00:31:32,577
Whats the matter,
you scared of women?

284
00:31:32,777 --> 00:31:35,577
Look,
what do you want from me?

285
00:31:35,908 --> 00:31:38,458
I want a set of clean sheets.

286
00:31:39,394 --> 00:31:41,342
And I want drapes
for my windows.

287
00:31:41,542 --> 00:31:42,845
Want, want, want.

288
00:31:43,045 --> 00:31:45,022
I want my house livable.

289
00:31:45,222 --> 00:31:48,085
You have to make
it livable yourself.

290
00:31:48,285 --> 00:31:50,445
Oh, listen to that.

291
00:31:50,645 --> 00:31:54,040
Isn't that just
typical of a stone cop.

292
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,805
You bulls are all the same. I know what you want.
You want me to beg for favours. Ok, I'll beg.

293
00:32:01,354 --> 00:32:02,805
Look.

294
00:32:04,337 --> 00:32:05,948
Clean sheets.

295
00:32:06,148 --> 00:32:07,748
Clean sheets.

296
00:32:07,948 --> 00:32:09,497
Gimme clean sheets.

297
00:32:09,697 --> 00:32:11,742
Drapes.

298
00:32:12,171 --> 00:32:14,274
Clean sheets.

299
00:32:16,411 --> 00:32:18,366
Drapes for my windows.

300
00:32:20,388 --> 00:32:21,245
Gimme drapes.

301
00:32:21,445 --> 00:32:23,485
Don't you dare kiss me!

302
00:32:42,365 --> 00:32:44,251
Hold me.

303
00:32:51,737 --> 00:32:54,517
Takes a woman to take
a man out of himself.

304
00:32:54,617 --> 00:32:58,697
But to do that, she's got
to be better than him.

305
00:33:20,953 --> 00:33:22,606
What are you looking for?
What are you looking for?

306
00:33:22,806 --> 00:33:24,366
Harry?

307
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:28,146
- Do you want me to have a handkerchief?
- Yeah.

308
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:29,000
No, not necessarily.

309
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,720
I don't like your attitude,
Harry.

310
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,640
Forgot the
dish-washing liquid.

311
00:33:40,706 --> 00:33:43,766
Oh, she told you,
it's Rita's fault.

312
00:34:02,406 --> 00:34:05,200
You know,
I could call in sick today.

313
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,246
No, you don't have to. Teresa's
going to come by and see me later.

314
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:11,046
Really? Will she stay?

315
00:34:11,246 --> 00:34:12,906
I don't know but it
doesnt matter, I'll be Ok.

316
00:34:13,106 --> 00:34:15,571
Really, don't worry about me.

317
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,766
How's it going, sweetheart?
I missed you punching out.

318
00:35:11,966 --> 00:35:13,320
Is that your wheels?

319
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,300
Yeah, this is them.

320
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,046
You gonna give me a ride?

321
00:35:17,246 --> 00:35:20,020
Sure, hop on.

322
00:35:20,173 --> 00:35:22,506
Ok.

323
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:31,653
- Hey, Emily, I want to give you a little advice.
- You smell nice.

324
00:35:31,853 --> 00:35:35,253
Oh, thank you,
that's my private stash.

325
00:35:36,146 --> 00:35:38,433
Feel nice too.

326
00:35:38,866 --> 00:35:41,346
That's cause I'm
such a nice guy.

327
00:35:41,546 --> 00:35:44,913
Look I been around here long enough to
know what I'm talking about all right?

328
00:35:45,113 --> 00:35:48,173
- If I were you...
- Can I have a hit?

329
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:56,706
Look, if I were you, I wouldn't trust Rita
as far as I could throw her, all right?

330
00:35:56,866 --> 00:35:57,973
How come?

331
00:35:58,173 --> 00:36:01,373
Because she keeps spreading
these stories about you.

332
00:36:01,573 --> 00:36:02,993
Good stories or bad stories?

333
00:36:03,193 --> 00:36:05,853
Well, some shit about
you being in jail.

334
00:36:06,053 --> 00:36:08,093
It was garbage, right?

335
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:10,486
I know, it's cool if you were.

336
00:36:10,686 --> 00:36:12,393
Fuck me, Rita said that?

337
00:36:12,593 --> 00:36:16,613
Yeah, Rita said it the other
day. How long were you in for?

338
00:36:16,813 --> 00:36:19,890
Well, Rita's lying.
I've never been in jail.

339
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:22,180
That's what I figured.
She's got some problems.

340
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,986
It's horse shit.

341
00:36:24,186 --> 00:36:26,091
Let's hit it.

342
00:36:28,126 --> 00:36:31,611
- Hang on tight, all right?
- All right.

343
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,520
Hey, Emily!

344
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,915
Some other time, Harry.

345
00:37:00,106 --> 00:37:01,520
Hi.

346
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,566
Rita in there?

347
00:37:03,766 --> 00:37:06,826
Yeah.
Getting ready for a meeting.

348
00:37:07,353 --> 00:37:09,560
Old Nudd asked me to
give her a message.

349
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,140
You remember me, don't you?

350
00:37:13,046 --> 00:37:14,180
You scared me.

351
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:16,260
Does that turn you on?

352
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,560
Maybe.

353
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:26,413
Wait! What the hell?

354
00:37:26,613 --> 00:37:28,568
I was never in prison.

355
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,073
That was somebody else.

356
00:37:30,273 --> 00:37:32,073
Snitch!

357
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:35,453
Well, yeah, you were down sixteen dollars
yesterday but I didn't say anything.

358
00:37:35,506 --> 00:37:39,161
Don't you ever spread
lies about me again.

359
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,753
Bye, bye.

360
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:56,945
Baby, you all right?
Get your ass movin', we're late.

361
00:38:07,653 --> 00:38:09,160
Pike.

362
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:13,253
Could you get me a security
lock for the front door?

363
00:38:13,453 --> 00:38:17,873
You wanna keep people out
or you want to stay in?

364
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:22,746
Well, I just don't want
anyone to steal my stuff.

365
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,500
Now you don't want something.

366
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:29,185
<i>Lot of these chicks
keep crying murder</i>

367
00:38:29,626 --> 00:38:33,480
<i>Me, I don't have
to move my hand</i>

368
00:38:37,413 --> 00:38:41,323
<i>Yes, let these chicks
keep crying hard luck</i>

369
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:45,346
<i>Me, I don't have to move my hand</i>

370
00:38:49,366 --> 00:38:52,546
<i>I got myself a
little apartment</i>

371
00:38:53,866 --> 00:38:57,186
<i>Dog and a cat
and a working man</i>

372
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:04,050
<i>He'd never win no
beauty contest</i>

373
00:39:05,713 --> 00:39:08,846
<i>Goodness knows he
don't dress fine</i>

374
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:16,585
<i>I said he'd never win
no beauty contest</i>

375
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:21,080
<i>Goodness knows he
don't dress fine</i>

376
00:39:22,553 --> 00:39:23,713
Gimme a beer, Ok?

377
00:39:23,913 --> 00:39:25,606
Not allowed to sell them.

378
00:39:25,806 --> 00:39:28,866
<i>Ah,
but he's healthy and ambitious</i>

379
00:39:29,833 --> 00:39:32,986
<i>And he lays it on the line</i>

380
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:35,946
I'm getting outta here.

381
00:39:36,146 --> 00:39:40,120
<i>I don't want no hepster lover</i>

382
00:39:41,737 --> 00:39:44,886
<i>They've got larceny
in their eyes</i>

383
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:51,806
<i>I don't want no hepster lover</i>

384
00:39:51,866 --> 00:39:54,161
Hey, Neil, check this out.

385
00:39:58,513 --> 00:40:00,080
Say, I think I'm in love!

386
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:04,700
<i>Too slick for that jive!
Got a hand full of gimme</i>

387
00:40:05,246 --> 00:40:08,586
<i>and a mouth full
of much obliged</i>

388
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,040
<i>Ah but when people
see us out together</i>

389
00:40:16,766 --> 00:40:20,440
<i>They kind of laugh
and turn away</i>

390
00:40:28,866 --> 00:40:32,086
<i>Kind of sneer and turn away</i>

391
00:40:35,086 --> 00:40:38,580
<i>Ah, but the joke
is on them baby</i>

392
00:40:40,433 --> 00:40:44,343
<i>Cause I'm eating three
square meals everyday</i>

393
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:56,133
<i>All right, chicks, stop crying
murder if you'd just adopt my plan</i>

394
00:40:58,526 --> 00:41:02,846
<i>Yes, you glamour girls
can stop crying inflation</i>

395
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:07,573
<i>If you'd just adopt my plan</i>

396
00:41:11,408 --> 00:41:14,480
<i>Stop letting these
hepsters jive you</i>

397
00:41:15,888 --> 00:41:19,312
<i>Get yourself a working man</i>

398
00:41:56,753 --> 00:41:57,693
Dry martini, please.

399
00:41:57,893 --> 00:41:59,586
Sure, at the bar.

400
00:41:59,786 --> 00:42:00,793
Oh, I'm waiting for someone.

401
00:42:00,993 --> 00:42:03,133
Right. At the bar.

402
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,193
Ok.

403
00:42:13,985 --> 00:42:17,135
- This one here is real pretty also.
- You like?

404
00:42:17,153 --> 00:42:19,760
Sorry, not interested.

405
00:42:20,166 --> 00:42:22,760
- Ladies.
- Bye, Larry.

406
00:43:00,773 --> 00:43:04,466
In the oven at 350,
stick in the cloves.

407
00:45:49,173 --> 00:45:50,326
Who are you?

408
00:45:50,526 --> 00:45:52,941
What do you want?

409
00:45:53,686 --> 00:45:56,831
You just get out
of here right now.

410
00:45:57,333 --> 00:45:59,798
I'm going to call the police.

411
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,145
So, you got a name?

412
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:08,725
My husband will
be home any second.

413
00:46:14,493 --> 00:46:16,080
Neil?

414
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,313
This for you?

415
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,280
Barbara.

416
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,160
How do you know my name?

417
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,266
- How do you know Neil?
- How do you know my name?

418
00:46:29,466 --> 00:46:31,293
How do you know, Neil?

419
00:46:31,493 --> 00:46:33,353
Butterfly.

420
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:39,730
Pop the tomato, you spend twelve
years cleaning up the mess.

421
00:46:48,753 --> 00:46:51,423
Are you a good fuck?

422
00:46:52,273 --> 00:46:54,313
Yes, you're a good fuck.

423
00:46:54,813 --> 00:46:57,146
And a good cook.

424
00:47:00,573 --> 00:47:02,906
Neil's wife.

425
00:47:03,913 --> 00:47:06,286
Where do you know Neil from?

426
00:47:06,486 --> 00:47:09,593
I met Neil in the
back of a crowded car.

427
00:47:09,793 --> 00:47:13,533
He must have been
about 12 years old then.

428
00:48:09,706 --> 00:48:11,680
How'd it go today?

429
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:14,005
I said how'd it go today.

430
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,050
Nothing happened.

431
00:48:32,606 --> 00:48:35,293
<i>what did you see today and
what are people talking about?</i>

432
00:48:35,393 --> 00:48:38,706
<i>Well, Arlene,
today I saw faces.</i>

433
00:48:39,046 --> 00:48:41,960
<i>Yet I saw violence
on those faces.</i>

434
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:45,960
<i>Today, people are
talking about themselves.</i>

435
00:48:46,026 --> 00:48:51,146
<i>It's that time of year when a family likes
to snuggle together before a cozy fire</i>

436
00:48:51,346 --> 00:48:53,811
<i>and anticipate the holidays.</i>

437
00:48:54,146 --> 00:48:56,726
<i>When a man likes to
light up a good cigar</i>

438
00:48:56,846 --> 00:48:58,966
<i>or open a beer
before the next game.</i>

439
00:48:59,133 --> 00:49:03,906
<i>The woman window shops
for just the right scarf</i>

440
00:49:03,966 --> 00:49:08,840
<i>to go under that winter coat
that's been in mothballs all year.</i>

441
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:13,200
<i>I saw young lovers arguing,
then making up.</i>

442
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:18,040
<i>And I saw a traffic officer
warning, instead of ticketing.</i>

443
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:22,226
<i>It's that time of year when one
needs to escape within himself</i>

444
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:27,563
<i>and forget the problems of the
past and plan for the future.</i>

445
00:49:27,786 --> 00:49:29,113
<i>You know, Arlene,</i>

446
00:49:29,313 --> 00:49:33,926
<i>I think that may be the reason no one
is talking about the Budapest earthquake...</i>

447
00:49:34,126 --> 00:49:36,251
<i>They don't understand it</i>

448
00:49:51,873 --> 00:49:58,440
<i>Gee,
but it's hard to love someone</i>

449
00:49:59,233 --> 00:50:04,200
<i>When that someone
don't love you</i>

450
00:50:07,766 --> 00:50:13,600
<i>I'm so disgusted
Heartbroken too</i>

451
00:50:15,333 --> 00:50:21,193
<i>I got the downhearted blues</i>

452
00:50:22,895 --> 00:50:29,113
<i>Once I was crazy about a man</i>

453
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:34,820
<i>He mistreated
me all the time</i>

454
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:49,913
<i>Next man I get got to
promise to be mine, all mine</i>

455
00:50:51,037 --> 00:50:53,786
<i>Lord he mistreated me</i>

456
00:50:55,160 --> 00:51:00,733
<i>He drove me from his door</i>

457
00:51:01,333 --> 00:51:03,446
<i>Dirty dog</i>

458
00:51:05,833 --> 00:51:08,493
<i>Yes, he mistreated me</i>

459
00:51:09,026 --> 00:51:15,613
<i>Oh, he drove me from his door</i>

460
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:31,226
<i>Ah but the good book says, you
got to reap just what you sow</i>

461
00:51:56,586 --> 00:51:58,796
Guess who I saw tonight?

462
00:52:00,213 --> 00:52:01,986
Neil.

463
00:52:04,613 --> 00:52:07,418
And as soon as
he saw me I ran.

464
00:52:10,613 --> 00:52:13,113
And he followed me.

465
00:52:16,953 --> 00:52:18,908
I ran to the beach...

466
00:52:21,446 --> 00:52:23,741
...and I fell in the sand.

467
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,246
He held me.

468
00:52:27,486 --> 00:52:30,966
You've been short every day since
you started. 86 dollars in all.

469
00:52:31,146 --> 00:52:34,620
Rita didn't tell me for three days, I almost
fired her too, but you're through as of right now.

470
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:36,490
- I didn't steal any money
- I didn't say stole it.

471
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:40,175
You're just short and
I won't discuss it.

472
00:52:41,086 --> 00:52:45,081
- Mr. Nudd, I want to speak to you alone
- No.

473
00:52:49,873 --> 00:52:51,828
Rita, get back to work.

474
00:52:52,506 --> 00:52:55,226
Close the door Rita,
will ya?

475
00:52:57,730 --> 00:52:59,520
I don't want to hear
any stories, Emily.

476
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,640
I get all the stories
I need from my mother.

477
00:53:01,726 --> 00:53:05,886
You people are lucky I have
a soft spot in my own family.

478
00:53:06,086 --> 00:53:10,266
I did not take any money and
I did not make any mistakes.

479
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:12,686
Argue with the adding
machine too, that's it.

480
00:53:12,886 --> 00:53:13,653
It wasn't my fault.

481
00:53:13,853 --> 00:53:19,413
I don't have to hear any of this. I warned you
right in the beginning about all everything.

482
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:23,446
Mr. Nudd, you're going to have your money
back in the cash register tomorrow night.

483
00:53:23,513 --> 00:53:26,373
- That's not the point.
- I promise.

484
00:53:26,573 --> 00:53:29,246
The point is that I'm innocent
and you're saying I'm guilty.

485
00:53:29,353 --> 00:53:31,650
Because of
circumstantial evidence.

486
00:53:31,850 --> 00:53:32,850
And because you're a bigot.

487
00:53:33,050 --> 00:53:37,033
- Bigot my ass. I hired you in the first place,
lady - Did your mother ever tell you how she did it?

488
00:53:37,086 --> 00:53:39,120
- Please, put that down.
- Did she ever tell you how she did it?

489
00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:41,933
- Oh, it was very nasty.
- Listen you don't know what I've been through.

490
00:53:41,993 --> 00:53:44,226
You don't know what it's like to have
a mother who killed your own father.

491
00:53:44,286 --> 00:53:46,693
- Get out of here right now.
- Get your hands off me!

492
00:53:46,893 --> 00:53:50,653
And listen you're going to get your god damn
money back here whether you like it or not!

493
00:53:50,793 --> 00:53:54,693
Tomorrow night it's going to be right there!
I don't give a shit whether you fire me or not.

494
00:53:54,893 --> 00:53:56,426
Prick!

495
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:05,873
Stay through tomorrow.

496
00:54:06,073 --> 00:54:08,966
But not at the register,
in back with Harry.

497
00:54:09,166 --> 00:54:11,751
Thank you, Mr. Nudd.

498
00:54:36,146 --> 00:54:40,396
86 bucks in Nudd's office
tomorrow morning, Rita.

499
00:54:45,506 --> 00:54:47,886
Hey, Rita, what's happening?

500
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:52,095
I'm gonna kill that bitch!

501
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:09,593
Oh, bye, bye, sweetie, I'll see
you tomorrow, don't forget.

502
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:32,455
How you doin'?

503
00:55:35,766 --> 00:55:37,460
You gonna scare me again?

504
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:40,046
Look baby, I'm gonna do a
hell of a lot more than.

505
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:43,740
Goddamn son of a bitch!

506
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,033
- Mr. Nudd?
- Yeah?

507
00:56:11,233 --> 00:56:13,826
Hi I'm Barbara Curry,
I shop here all the time.

508
00:56:13,886 --> 00:56:18,026
- Yeah, I know you, we've met.
- Do you have a girl who works.

509
00:56:18,226 --> 00:56:21,493
I just saw, I just
saw something, I...

510
00:56:21,693 --> 00:56:24,393
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine. Could I make a phone call?

511
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:27,183
<i>Meanwhile the grim task of
searching for bodies continues.</i>

512
00:56:27,383 --> 00:56:30,548
<i>Primarily in the fifth and
eighth districts of the city.</i>

513
00:56:30,748 --> 00:56:33,713
<i>The areas of densest population
and tallest buildings.</i>

514
00:56:33,913 --> 00:56:39,980
<i>Pacific News Overseas reports that the
official death count now stands at 725,000.</i>

515
00:56:40,053 --> 00:56:43,626
I'm not sure it's her now. It was a
long time ago. She was blonde then.

516
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:46,066
Why don't you call the cops,
man?

517
00:56:46,266 --> 00:56:47,953
When's the last time
you called a cop?

518
00:56:48,153 --> 00:56:50,660
Hey listen, if you need some
heads busted let me know.

519
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:53,020
That's good. Thank you.

520
00:57:03,453 --> 00:57:06,038
See you later, Neil!

521
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:38,233
Hey, let's...

522
00:58:00,806 --> 00:58:03,136
- Hi, Pike.
- Hi.

523
00:58:03,686 --> 00:58:05,811
Thanks for the curtains.

524
00:58:06,526 --> 00:58:09,841
Did you remember
the security locks?

525
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:11,620
I like that.

526
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:14,220
California veneer.

527
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:16,885
That ought to keep them out.

528
00:58:29,513 --> 00:58:31,928
Do you live here?

529
00:58:32,446 --> 00:58:34,260
What's your name?

530
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:36,273
- Five seven...
- That's her. - Blue dress.

531
00:58:36,473 --> 00:58:38,110
- You're under arrest.
- It was only a pencil.

532
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:41,693
Pencil? It takes more than a
pencil to break a window, lady.

533
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:43,653
Break.

534
00:58:54,653 --> 00:58:56,453
Pike!

535
00:58:57,333 --> 00:58:59,238
Hey, Emily!

536
00:59:00,053 --> 00:59:01,866
Bye.

537
00:59:05,573 --> 00:59:08,243
Gone, just like that.

538
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:31,006
- This is a one-way mirror. I want you to
take your time and see if... - Yeah, that's her.

539
00:59:31,206 --> 00:59:32,860
Neil, that's her.

540
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:34,846
Are you sure, Mrs. Curry?

541
00:59:35,046 --> 00:59:36,440
Yes. I'm positive.

542
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:39,190
Do you want to file charges?

543
00:59:39,446 --> 00:59:40,666
Yes, I do.

544
00:59:40,866 --> 00:59:45,286
All right, why don't you
come outside with me then.

545
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:49,540
Mr. Curry?

546
00:59:56,146 --> 00:59:57,900
- Come right over here, please.
- Neil, who is she?

547
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:01,720
Look, Barbara, it turns out that
this is someone I used know.

548
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:04,566
And I had no idea that she
was in town and that is.

549
01:00:04,570 --> 01:00:07,633
Bernice, I need a
forms for a 415 booking.

550
01:00:07,833 --> 01:00:10,529
That was changed
to 419 last March.

551
01:00:10,729 --> 01:00:13,425
Yeah, they're always
changing something.

552
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:15,186
Ok, I want ten of those.

553
01:00:15,386 --> 01:00:17,986
Look, I want to explain this whole
thing to you, but it's just complicated.

554
01:00:18,186 --> 01:00:19,666
and it's just stupid to
get involved with the cops.

555
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:20,893
Neil,
I'm having her put in prison!

556
01:00:21,093 --> 01:00:23,306
I want you to
know everything!

557
01:00:23,506 --> 01:00:25,826
Mrs. Curry,
I need you over here a minute.

558
01:00:26,026 --> 01:00:28,693
Now what? I want ten of these?
And this is the first one?

559
01:00:28,753 --> 01:00:30,813
- Right, the second - Which
one of these goes first?

560
01:00:31,013 --> 01:00:33,066
Excuse-me... officer.

561
01:00:33,070 --> 01:00:34,980
Bottom line,
it goes like this:

562
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:39,780
I cant press charges against this woman unless
I have a chance to talk to her by myself.

563
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:45,146
Could you, could you arrange that?
Because that would be the best thing.

564
01:00:45,346 --> 01:00:47,676
It just would...

565
01:00:52,186 --> 01:00:54,906
Wait over there
by that table.

566
01:01:32,350 --> 01:01:32,940
Hi.

567
01:01:33,140 --> 01:01:36,640
Ok, let's keep this
short and sweet, Emily.

568
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:40,080
You cannot go around scaring the
shit out of us, you understand that?

569
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:43,293
I can't have that,
so just get that straight.

570
01:01:43,493 --> 01:01:44,540
Ok?

571
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:46,695
Nobody's getting hurt.

572
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:51,360
I only hurt people by
accident, remember?

573
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:55,095
Hey, Spidermonkey.

574
01:01:58,133 --> 01:02:01,573
Look at your hair. It's grey.

575
01:02:02,166 --> 01:02:03,906
Yeah.

576
01:02:04,473 --> 01:02:06,906
And your face.

577
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:12,540
You've really been through it,
huh?

578
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:16,100
Well, I guess you've been
through it too, haven't you?

579
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:19,466
But you look pretty good.
Yeah, you look good.

580
01:02:19,666 --> 01:02:21,586
I didn't recognize
you with dark hair.

581
01:02:21,786 --> 01:02:25,526
But you look healthy
and alive, it's great.

582
01:02:27,133 --> 01:02:28,760
You look healthy
and alive too.

583
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:31,066
Ok.

584
01:02:32,506 --> 01:02:34,666
Spidermonkey,
I wrote this speech.

585
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:38,086
- It's to you, do you want to hear it?
- Well, let me tell you, I'm not really into speeches.

586
01:02:38,286 --> 01:02:44,466
I've got my wife waiting outside and
I'd like to take her home, so... not really.

587
01:02:44,666 --> 01:02:46,320
Please?

588
01:02:48,793 --> 01:02:51,100
Ok, look, you sit over
here and I'll sit over here,

589
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:53,673
and we'll kind of observe the
amenities of this institution.

590
01:02:53,873 --> 01:02:56,573
Go ahead, what is it?

591
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:06,186
Ok.

592
01:03:07,060 --> 01:03:08,446
I didn't cry when
you disappeared.

593
01:03:08,646 --> 01:03:10,206
Hold it! I had my
reasons for moving away.

594
01:03:10,406 --> 01:03:12,106
I had my reasons for
getting married again.

595
01:03:12,306 --> 01:03:14,580
I thought everything out
and I came up with reasons.

596
01:03:14,646 --> 01:03:18,613
- And, believe it or not, I understand
how you feel, Emily - Hold me.

597
01:03:18,813 --> 01:03:20,768
- Hold you?
- Hold me.

598
01:03:20,973 --> 01:03:23,560
- Hold me. Please.
- No.

599
01:03:26,073 --> 01:03:28,246
No.

600
01:03:28,473 --> 01:03:32,753
Oh I get it, you don't want
to hold a convict bitch, huh?

601
01:03:32,953 --> 01:03:36,993
- Drugged and raped and dirty...
- Hey, what do you want from me?

602
01:03:37,046 --> 01:03:41,260
You cant tear out my soul because
I've already done that myself.

603
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:43,500
Ok?

604
01:03:43,913 --> 01:03:45,866
Ok.

605
01:03:46,066 --> 01:03:48,406
Hold me.

606
01:03:48,613 --> 01:03:50,960
Hold me.

607
01:03:52,913 --> 01:03:54,953
Hold me.

608
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,340
Listen.

609
01:04:03,686 --> 01:04:06,661
I didn't cry when
you disappeared.

610
01:04:07,513 --> 01:04:10,063
I was very worried about you.

611
01:04:10,966 --> 01:04:13,653
But I figured that you
had to do your own time.

612
01:04:13,853 --> 01:04:15,808
And I understood that.

613
01:04:17,293 --> 01:04:22,833
Do you really want to know what kept
me alive during those 4,380 days?

614
01:04:23,033 --> 01:04:23,940
Ghosts.

615
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:27,466
And one in particular. Yours.

616
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:31,280
You were with
me all the time.

617
01:04:32,937 --> 01:04:39,434
And when I looked at people, pretty soon came a
time when I could only see the landscape behind.

618
01:04:39,634 --> 01:04:43,405
But when I looked for you,
you were there.

619
01:04:44,662 --> 01:04:47,908
with your face and your eyes.

620
01:04:48,731 --> 01:04:50,177
and your hands.

621
01:04:50,377 --> 01:04:51,902
And you came to me.

622
01:04:52,102 --> 01:04:56,607
and you talked me in that
deep sexy voice of yours.

623
01:04:57,702 --> 01:05:00,737
And you did wonderful
things with me.

624
01:05:00,937 --> 01:05:03,742
Things we used
to be shy about.

625
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,131
You love me, Neil.

626
01:05:06,331 --> 01:05:10,188
I'm the most important thing in your
life, remember you told me that.

627
01:05:10,388 --> 01:05:12,548
Remember?

628
01:05:13,211 --> 01:05:14,794
Just one more thing, Neil.

629
01:05:14,994 --> 01:05:16,680
I want you to know.

630
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:20,988
You're the very first person
that's held me in 12 years.

631
01:05:21,188 --> 01:05:23,714
I saved it for you.

632
01:05:24,491 --> 01:05:26,114
Hold me.

633
01:05:31,714 --> 01:05:33,805
Ok, we've finished now.

634
01:05:35,268 --> 01:05:37,171
Listen.

635
01:05:37,371 --> 01:05:40,377
I have enough money to keep us
going till you get started again.

636
01:05:40,491 --> 01:05:43,000
And there's enough room at
my place for both of us.

637
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,750
My address is in your pocket.

638
01:05:47,371 --> 01:05:50,431
So, I'll just wait for you to call.

639
01:06:02,354 --> 01:06:07,594
I don't think we're going to be pressing
those charges. You know what I mean?

640
01:06:07,794 --> 01:06:09,417
My wife...

641
01:06:10,285 --> 01:06:12,417
My other wife.

642
01:06:19,384 --> 01:06:21,400
Hey, thank you.
Thank you for your...

643
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,508
Ok, Shortpie, let's go!

644
01:06:24,708 --> 01:06:26,714
Who is she, Neil?

645
01:06:26,914 --> 01:06:28,982
I told you who she was.

646
01:06:29,085 --> 01:06:35,290
- She's someone I used to - They said
she was an ex-convict! Who is she?

647
01:06:37,222 --> 01:06:39,687
I used to be married to her.

648
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:44,760
You liar!

649
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:46,325
When were you
married to her?

650
01:06:46,525 --> 01:06:50,771
It was a long time ago. It was New York
City. It's got nothing to do with us.

651
01:06:50,971 --> 01:06:58,536
- Why didn't you tell me this before, you liar?
- God damn it, Barbara, will you come on?

652
01:07:30,422 --> 01:07:32,902
- Emily?
- Hi.

653
01:07:33,931 --> 01:07:36,481
Why'd the cops take you away?

654
01:07:38,125 --> 01:07:40,540
Just an accident.

655
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:45,354
Why don't mind your
own fucking business?

656
01:07:45,554 --> 01:07:49,039
Hey, hey, hey,
look what I got for you.

657
01:07:55,828 --> 01:08:00,091
<i>I noticed you've been
acting very strange dear</i>

658
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:03,531
<i>You've never treated
me this way dear</i>

659
01:08:03,634 --> 01:08:06,754
Who the hell put
that thing in here?

660
01:08:06,891 --> 01:08:09,611
<i>You say you've
found somebody else</i>

661
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:11,645
Emily!

662
01:08:13,668 --> 01:08:15,623
I can help you, Emily.

663
01:08:17,017 --> 01:08:18,760
Afraid you can't help.

664
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:23,377
Oh, I know how it is when
you're in trouble with the cops.

665
01:08:23,577 --> 01:08:27,674
I got some money saved, hundred and
twenty, hundred and thirty dollars.

666
01:08:27,874 --> 01:08:31,697
You can pay me back when
things are right for you.

667
01:08:31,897 --> 01:08:34,834
Look, I'll tell you what.

668
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:39,030
I'll put anything in
your apartment you want.

669
01:08:40,868 --> 01:08:42,491
Emily?

670
01:08:45,611 --> 01:08:47,462
Ok.

671
01:08:48,514 --> 01:08:50,205
Good.

672
01:08:51,302 --> 01:08:54,200
- Why cant you just trust me?
- I've trusted you all along!

673
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:58,588
- I know but have I ever let you down?
- Neil, this woman is dangerous and you're protecting her.

674
01:08:58,788 --> 01:09:01,600
That policeman said she was a
murderer, why are you protecting her?

675
01:09:01,714 --> 01:09:04,468
- She's not a murderer. There was any murder involved.
- Then why did she go to prison?

676
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:07,140
It was an accident.

677
01:09:09,245 --> 01:09:12,502
The girl went to prison because
the whole thing looked like murder.

678
01:09:12,702 --> 01:09:16,582
Well, I want to know why
it looked like murder.

679
01:09:17,051 --> 01:09:19,617
You want to know a hell
of a lot, don't you?

680
01:09:19,817 --> 01:09:24,662
When I was married to her, things didn't work
out as well as they work out between you and me.

681
01:09:24,754 --> 01:09:27,805
I was having an affair with the girl at
the office that everybody else was having.

682
01:09:27,931 --> 01:09:30,662
This girl got hit by the car.

683
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:34,925
- You know, you ask me to, to listen
to this story... - It only get's worse.

684
01:09:35,050 --> 01:09:39,748
- and I think you could do me the decency to listen to this story!
- by her lying husband but I'm not hanging around to find out.

685
01:09:39,885 --> 01:09:42,045
- You know, you're being stupid about this, Barba.
- Just let go of me, dammit!

686
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:45,382
- You know, I happen to have sympathy for this girl.
- Well, that's more than you feel for me!

687
01:09:45,565 --> 01:09:48,235
You really think so?

688
01:09:51,382 --> 01:09:52,428
I feel a love for you

689
01:09:52,628 --> 01:09:54,440
Neil! Let go of me!

690
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:55,765
<i>don't forget, baby,</i>

691
01:09:55,965 --> 01:09:58,680
<i>what I'm trying to say</i>

692
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:02,697
<i>It's your time now</i>

693
01:10:03,302 --> 01:10:06,960
<i>Aw, but it's going to be mine</i>

694
01:10:07,074 --> 01:10:09,960
<i>some sweet day</i>

695
01:10:15,577 --> 01:10:21,394
<i>And the cold winds do blow</i>

696
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:34,954
<i>proceeds set aside for
those quake victims.</i>

697
01:10:35,154 --> 01:10:40,405
<i>The Association urges Non-Hungarian
restaurants to join in their cause.</i>

698
01:10:40,605 --> 01:10:41,651
<i>Northridge.</i>

699
01:10:41,851 --> 01:10:45,177
<i>A Cal State Northridge sociology
professor has published a report</i>

700
01:10:45,337 --> 01:10:50,891
<i>claiming that repression and not depression
is primarily responsible for violent crimes,</i>

701
01:10:50,982 --> 01:10:58,632
<i>and that there is a direct link between
repression and chemical additives used in foods</i>

702
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,640
Hey, Frankie?

703
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,748
This check looks a
little thin to me.

704
01:11:29,874 --> 01:11:31,742
- I docked you thirty bucks.
- What for?

705
01:11:31,942 --> 01:11:35,880
Fifteen for being late. And
fifteen for being a smart ass.

706
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:38,171
Well, as I see that's
fifteen you owe me.

707
01:11:38,274 --> 01:11:41,422
As I see it,
I don't owe you anything, pal.

708
01:11:41,622 --> 01:11:44,868
- Let's talk about this, Ok? - We're not talking about
anything, you got that? We're through.

709
01:11:44,870 --> 01:11:51,075
You get out of here, I don't want to
see your face around here no more.

710
01:11:56,790 --> 01:11:59,020
Hey, stay there.

711
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:22,020
Hey, let's go somewhere and
grab a drink, what do you say?

712
01:12:22,710 --> 01:12:25,400
Only if we go
to a nice place.

713
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:29,340
Yeah? I don't know any
nice places anymore.

714
01:12:30,740 --> 01:12:33,096
But I would just like to sit down
and have a drink with you.

715
01:12:33,246 --> 01:12:36,740
I mean, you and I should be able
to do that, don't you think?

716
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:38,240
Ok, let's go.

717
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:39,350
Ok, let's go.

718
01:12:39,550 --> 01:12:42,035
And I'm not going to apologize
for the years, Emily.

719
01:12:42,135 --> 01:12:44,620
I figure you'll square that in
your own distinct way.

720
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:46,825
But I do think you and I
ought to be able to

721
01:12:47,095 --> 01:12:52,724
just sit down and have a
drink together, huh?

722
01:13:48,830 --> 01:13:52,850
- I have all the good parts underlined.
- I just can't believe that.

723
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:56,540
If you want to borrow it,
you're welcome.

724
01:14:09,980 --> 01:14:15,010
Yes, I would like two
double extra dry martinis.

725
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:16,940
At the bar.

726
01:14:17,450 --> 01:14:18,820
Well, I'm waiting for someone.

727
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:22,620
You want a drink, at the bar.
You want to eat, in the booth.

728
01:14:22,820 --> 01:14:24,810
So, we'll eat.

729
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:28,420
All right, would you like a
cocktail before dinner sir?

730
01:14:28,510 --> 01:14:29,880
Yeah, two beers.

731
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:31,815
Two beers.

732
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:36,185
- Two beers, Mike.
- Two beers coming up.

733
01:14:37,150 --> 01:14:38,000
Want a smoke?

734
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:40,155
No, I gave up smoking.

735
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:45,610
- You quit smoking?  - I quit smoking.
I still bite my nails, but I quit smoking.

736
01:14:45,790 --> 01:14:49,870
Wow. Let's see. Oh dear, yes.

737
01:14:50,270 --> 01:14:56,210
- If you had someone to take care of you,
you wouldn't bite your nails. - Two beers.

738
01:14:56,410 --> 01:15:00,480
You forgot the two double
dry martinis, extra dry.

739
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:01,640
Yes, ma'am.

740
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:03,470
What dry martinis?

741
01:15:03,670 --> 01:15:06,770
You used to drink martinis,
we used to drink martinis.

742
01:15:06,970 --> 01:15:09,520
I used to do a lot of things.

743
01:15:10,610 --> 01:15:13,680
Do you remember when we
used to go Rockefeller Plaza.

744
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:17,540
And you used to order
martinis extra extra dry?

745
01:15:17,740 --> 01:15:19,510
Sure, I remember that.

746
01:15:19,710 --> 01:15:24,220
And do you remember how we used to sit watch the
funny man play his drumsticks on the sidewalk?

747
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:26,170
Yeah, I remember that too.

748
01:15:26,370 --> 01:15:28,140
Do you?

749
01:15:28,890 --> 01:15:32,190
- Do you remember the name of the place?
- Two double dry martinis.

750
01:15:32,390 --> 01:15:34,070
Max's.

751
01:15:34,270 --> 01:15:36,220
Would you like to
look at the menu, sir?

752
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:38,970
Yeah, show me the drink list.

753
01:15:39,470 --> 01:15:41,250
List...

754
01:15:44,390 --> 01:15:47,840
You want to start at the bottom
of this thing and work up?

755
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:49,780
Two zombies.

756
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:52,140
Two zombies...

757
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:55,970
- So, to Max's
- To Max's.

758
01:15:56,170 --> 01:16:00,080
- Two zombies, Mike.
- Two zombies, coming up.

759
01:16:00,330 --> 01:16:03,240
- I don't know what you're trying to do but I...
- I'm not trying to do anything.

760
01:16:03,390 --> 01:16:05,830
It's doing it'self. Look.

761
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:08,270
See how it's doing itself?

762
01:16:08,470 --> 01:16:09,990
- Come on, Emily.
- See?

763
01:16:10,190 --> 01:16:12,605
Just ground rules.

764
01:16:16,750 --> 01:16:18,400
Would you like to order now, sir?

765
01:16:19,110 --> 01:16:20,496
Yes.

766
01:16:21,008 --> 01:16:22,840
Two...

767
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:25,230
Screwdrivers.

768
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:27,970
Double screwdrivers.

769
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:33,865
- Two double screwdrivers.
- Listen, we're falling behind here.

770
01:16:38,970 --> 01:16:42,370
Oh, blech! That is horrible!

771
01:16:44,010 --> 01:16:46,560
They make a poor zombie here.

772
01:16:46,970 --> 01:16:49,010
Stay with the martinis.

773
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:56,290
I gonna get rid of
those two assholes.

774
01:16:56,460 --> 01:16:59,870
How are you?
You know what I mean by that?

775
01:16:59,980 --> 01:17:03,320
- How are I?
- Yeah, how are you living?

776
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:06,960
I'm really just
the same as before.

777
01:17:07,130 --> 01:17:09,470
- I smoke clove cigarettes.
- Two double Manhattans.

778
01:17:09,580 --> 01:17:13,350
and I still wear
my wedding ring.

779
01:17:13,630 --> 01:17:17,140
But hey. Hey!

780
01:17:18,190 --> 01:17:20,040
What are you doing?

781
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:22,580
What am I doing?

782
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:27,740
Well, I'm just sitting here having
a few drinks with my ex-wife.

783
01:17:27,830 --> 01:17:33,200
fifty-five tax, two-fifty each, cover charge for the use
of the booth, that comes to fifty dollars and thirty cents.

784
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:34,470
How you fixed for money?

785
01:17:34,670 --> 01:17:37,020
Oo, boy, I got money.

786
01:17:37,150 --> 01:17:45,055
Well, I'm really glad to hear that lady because
I'm gonna need fifty dollars and thirty cents.

787
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:49,310
I bet I have more
money than you.

788
01:17:49,510 --> 01:17:50,940
You have more money than me?

789
01:17:51,140 --> 01:17:57,690
Oh man, I have about ten thousand times
more money than you. Let's see your money.

790
01:17:57,890 --> 01:18:00,920
I'll make you a bet. If I
have more money than you...

791
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:02,020
If you.

792
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:04,350
You get to pay the bill.

793
01:18:05,210 --> 01:18:08,350
And I get to take you home.

794
01:18:08,530 --> 01:18:10,340
Fair bet?

795
01:18:11,230 --> 01:18:13,990
Here we have twenty, forty.

796
01:18:14,110 --> 01:18:16,460
- Forty-five, and...
- We got it.

797
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:18,270
And fifty-nine,
I always carry on me.

798
01:18:18,470 --> 01:18:19,590
- Let's see your money, Neil.
- Is that it?

799
01:18:19,790 --> 01:18:22,730
- Let's see your money.
- No, I got a more.

800
01:18:22,930 --> 01:18:25,000
I got a hundred in here.

801
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:27,290
Shit!

802
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:29,990
- I'd like to see some change out of this.
- Hold it!

803
01:18:30,190 --> 01:18:33,190
I got eighty-six bucks,
twenty,

804
01:18:33,470 --> 01:18:37,050
forty, sixty,
eighty, eighty-five.

805
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:39,980
Eighty-six,
count that up, so...

806
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:43,750
I win, you get to
pay the bill, and...

807
01:18:44,230 --> 01:18:46,000
You get to come home with me.

808
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:47,770
Here you go.

809
01:18:47,970 --> 01:18:50,010
- So, you pay?
- I pay.

810
01:18:51,410 --> 01:18:53,330
And I get to come
home with you.

811
01:18:53,530 --> 01:18:57,240
- And I take you home.
- So, as I see it...

812
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:59,420
I win.

813
01:18:59,620 --> 01:19:01,550
Yeah, you sure do.

814
01:19:01,750 --> 01:19:03,540
My friend left with this dog.

815
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:06,030
That dog can talk.

816
01:19:06,230 --> 01:19:09,150
Had me a dog that
can talk for years.

817
01:19:09,350 --> 01:19:12,665
When you feel something...
like that.

818
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:18,710
You don't push yourself.

819
01:19:21,740 --> 01:19:25,760
Maybe optional for some,
but it ain't optional to me.

820
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:28,085
I can't stand that stuff.

821
01:19:30,610 --> 01:19:32,910
Some people...

822
01:19:33,110 --> 01:19:38,120
I got a visit around here that
carried 3000 at that time.

823
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:39,410
I don't want to go.

824
01:19:41,793 --> 01:19:43,049
That's the main thing.

825
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:49,240
How's it going, it's a
beautiful evening isn't it?

826
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:51,735
Well, you know how it goes.

827
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:54,240
Nobody knows.

828
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:56,610
If you had any sense,
you'd do it.

829
01:19:56,810 --> 01:19:59,010
God, I do know.

830
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:07,280
I got to say this.

831
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:09,470
You and I...

832
01:20:09,860 --> 01:20:11,595
really...

833
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:16,505
Really fucked each
others lives up.

834
01:20:17,020 --> 01:20:21,650
But I want to shake your hand
anyway and say that it's okay.

835
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:24,520
Is that loud enough?

836
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:30,885
I just got to
get you up there.

837
01:20:33,660 --> 01:20:36,170
My cabin plans.

838
01:20:39,010 --> 01:20:41,255
My cabin plans.

839
01:20:42,010 --> 01:20:46,320
I'm going to build this
cabin up in eagle rock.

840
01:20:46,540 --> 01:20:47,820
Eagle Rock.

841
01:20:48,020 --> 01:20:51,020
Oh, shit!

842
01:20:52,130 --> 01:20:56,190
Do you know the best
thing about eagles?

843
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:06,730
- You Ok?
- Yeah.

844
01:21:06,930 --> 01:21:08,450
- You gonna barf?
- No.

845
01:21:08,650 --> 01:21:09,880
You sure?

846
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:12,500
Yeah,
but don't say that anyway.

847
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:14,910
Ok. You want some music?

848
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:17,395
I'll put on some music.

849
01:21:30,210 --> 01:21:31,260
Remember?

850
01:21:31,460 --> 01:21:33,535
Spidermonkey?

851
01:21:34,290 --> 01:21:36,280
Spidermonkey.

852
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:38,820
You awake?

853
01:21:39,460 --> 01:21:40,930
- You want some coffee?
- No.

854
01:21:41,130 --> 01:21:44,030
Honestly just get me some
club soda and a cold towel.

855
01:21:44,220 --> 01:21:46,345
I'll get you some coffee.

856
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:54,390
Go ahead, God.

857
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:58,600
Do it.

858
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:07,880
<i>The love I have for you</i>

859
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:14,450
<i>Makes my blue days bright</i>

860
01:22:18,890 --> 01:22:24,110
<i>Asleep or awake, dear</i>

861
01:22:25,490 --> 01:22:31,850
<i>Your face I see</i>

862
01:22:32,060 --> 01:22:37,310
<i>The sunshine of your smile</i>

863
01:22:38,580 --> 01:22:43,030
<i>Is a guide for me</i>

864
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:46,800
<i>The love I have for you</i>

865
01:22:49,610 --> 01:22:54,160
<i>Is within my heart</i>

866
01:22:55,820 --> 01:22:59,290
<i>The love I have for you</i>

867
01:22:59,380 --> 01:23:01,720
No, it feels good, really.

868
01:23:02,990 --> 01:23:07,500
<i>is a thing set apart</i>

869
01:23:10,660 --> 01:23:17,120
<i>You can search
this big wide world</i>

870
01:23:17,220 --> 01:23:22,640
<i>But my dear if you do</i>

871
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:28,270
<i>You'll never find a love like</i>

872
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:32,320
<i>the love I have for you</i>

873
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:39,050
<i>The love I have for you</i>

874
01:23:41,570 --> 01:23:45,330
<i>Makes my burdens light</i>

875
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:52,380
<i>The love I have for you</i>

876
01:23:54,780 --> 01:24:00,530
<i>Makes my blue days bright</i>

877
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:09,200
<i>Asleep or awake dear</i>

878
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:15,750
<i>Your face I see</i>

879
01:24:16,770 --> 01:24:22,310
<i>The sunshine of your smile</i>

880
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:31,530

<i>The love I have for you</i>

883

<i>Is a thing set apart</i>

884
01:24:55,440 --> 01:25:01,060
<i>If you search this universe</i>

885
01:25:01,830 --> 01:25:07,130
<i>My dear, if you do</i>

886
01:25:10,690 --> 01:25:15,620
<i>You'll never find a love like</i>

887
01:25:17,270 --> 01:25:22,310
<i>The love I have for you</i>

888
01:26:15,140 --> 01:26:18,580
Oh, Pike. Hi.

889
01:26:21,210 --> 01:26:23,350
How'd you like the
stuff I got you?

890
01:26:23,550 --> 01:26:24,650
I love it.

891
01:26:24,850 --> 01:26:27,145
I got you a work lamp too.

892
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:31,875
Hey, Emily...

893
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:34,555
Tonight's my night off.

894
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:43,940
Gotta work.

895
01:27:36,310 --> 01:27:38,435
What are you doin' here?

896
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:45,410
- What?
- I said, what are you doin' here?

897
01:27:45,610 --> 01:27:49,690
What the fuck does it
look like I'm doin' here?

898
01:27:54,570 --> 01:27:57,570
She owes me a hundred
and thirty dollars.

899
01:27:57,770 --> 01:28:01,935
And you can put this
fucking lamp up yourself!

900
01:28:06,410 --> 01:28:10,380
That's over six hundred dollars
so far. Hope she can pay for it.

901
01:28:10,580 --> 01:28:12,360
Why,
it looks wonderful on you.

902
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:15,860
Yes, I'll take it. And I'll take the
sweater with it, and I'll wear it.

903
01:28:16,060 --> 01:28:20,395
Fine. Oh, your husband
is just going to adore it.

904
01:28:21,370 --> 01:28:24,900
And I'd like to
take this one.

905
01:28:26,050 --> 01:28:27,220
Ok?

906
01:28:27,420 --> 01:28:30,070
Now, how much does
that all come to?

907
01:28:30,160 --> 01:28:34,460
Well, let's see, with this last one it's, uh,
six hundred and ninety-two dollars plus tax.

908
01:28:34,550 --> 01:28:36,730
Will that be cash or charge?

909
01:28:36,930 --> 01:28:39,905
- Oh, you take credit cards?
- Yes.

910
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:45,610
Thank you, Mrs. Curry.

911
01:28:45,810 --> 01:28:48,300
Would you like us
to box this one too?

912
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:50,800
No, that one never fit right.

913
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,390
- Why are you changing all your locks?
- It's none of your business.

914
01:28:53,590 --> 01:28:55,310
Yeah, well, but, if you want to
keep someone out of your house,

915
01:28:55,510 --> 01:28:57,230
all you have to do is change
the combinations on your locks.

916
01:28:57,430 --> 01:28:59,860
Listen, I want a whole bunch
of new locks in this house.

917
01:29:00,060 --> 01:29:01,750
And if you cant do it, I'll
get someone else to do it.

918
01:29:01,950 --> 01:29:04,950
Hey, I can do it. Let me go
get some shit out of my truck.

919
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:06,450
Jeez.

920
01:29:07,740 --> 01:29:09,520
The bitches I
work for every day.

921
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:13,000
<i>One indiscriminate turning
of the restless planet.</i>

922
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:16,900
<i>A planet perhaps that has become
too tolerant of man's inhumanity,</i>

923
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:19,050
<i>man's disregard,</i>

924
01:29:19,250 --> 01:29:23,510
<i>man's selfish and destructive
attitude toward himself and nature.</i>

925
01:29:23,710 --> 01:29:27,720
<i>When one thinks of one million innocent
victims who died randomly in time,</i>

926
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:30,480
<i>one cant help but reflect
on his own searches,</i>

927
01:29:30,580 --> 01:29:31,940
<i>his own struggles,</i>

928
01:29:32,140 --> 01:29:34,090
<i>his own randomness.</i>

929
01:29:34,340 --> 01:29:35,580
<i>One million dead,</i>

930
01:29:35,780 --> 01:29:39,050
<i>and certainly more when
the final count is tallied.</i>

931
01:29:39,250 --> 01:29:41,130
<i>But there will always
be more deaths,</i>

932
01:29:41,330 --> 01:29:46,960
<i>and it becomes us, the survivors, who must
accept the responsibility of the future.</i>

933
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:51,680
<i>Who must move on with the strength and
courage and goodwill of the fallen,</i>

934
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:53,620
<i>to live the better life.</i>

935
01:29:53,820 --> 01:29:57,610
<i>To live out our potential
as soulful human beings.</i>

936
01:29:57,810 --> 01:30:00,480
<i>I think we can do it.</i>

937
01:30:22,730 --> 01:30:25,400
Take these keys. I want you
to lock up my place, Pike.

938
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:28,210
Hey, who's that guy upstairs?

939
01:30:31,610 --> 01:30:33,710
Hey Emily!

940
01:31:06,140 --> 01:31:13,800
<i>Yes, you can take every advantage
of a fellow man that's down</i>

941
01:31:14,830 --> 01:31:23,490
<i>You can take somebody's heartstrings,
yes and drag it on the ground</i>

942
01:31:23,610 --> 01:31:31,200
<i>You can high hat other people
just because you're having luck</i>

943
01:31:31,310 --> 01:31:38,910
<i>Even double cross your best friend
and then try to pass the buck</i>

944
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:47,270
<i>Ah, but there's one thing that is
certain, makes no difference where you go</i>

945
01:31:47,580 --> 01:31:55,450
<i>Just before your final curtain,
you got to reap just what you sow</i>

946
01:31:55,770 --> 01:32:02,130
<i>You got to reap
just what you sow</i>

947
01:32:03,370 --> 01:32:09,980
<i>Yes, you got to reap
just what you sow</i>

948
01:32:10,260 --> 01:32:14,290
<i>The love I have for you</i>

949
01:32:16,930 --> 01:32:20,890
<i>Makes my burdens light</i>

950
01:32:23,140 --> 01:32:27,770
<i>The love I have for you</i>

951
01:32:29,860 --> 01:32:35,390
<i>Makes my blue days bright</i>

952
01:32:39,170 --> 01:32:44,980
<i>Asleep or awake dear</i>

953
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:51,408
<i>Your face I see</i>

954
01:32:52,112 --> 01:32:57,744
<i>The sunshine of your smile</i>

955
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:07,456
<i>Is a guide for me
The love I have for you</i>

956
01:33:09,184 --> 01:33:14,480
<i>Is within my heart</i>

957
01:33:15,952 --> 01:33:21,008
<i>The love I have for you</i>

958
01:33:21,808 --> 01:33:27,808
<i>Is a thing set apart</i>

<i>If you search this universe</i>

960
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:42,784
<i>My dear if you do</i>

961
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:52,064
<i>You'll never find a love like</i>

962
01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:58,800
<i>The love I have for you</i>
