1
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:09,316
برخیزید ای جوانان انقلابی مسلح شوید تا من 
Come all you young rebels enlist while

2
00:00:09,483 --> 00:00:13,983
برایتان بخوانم از عشق به وطن
I sing for love of one’s

3
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:18,692
که خانمان سوز است
country is a terrible thing

4
00:00:19,983 --> 00:00:26,567
ترس را به سرعت شعله ای دور می کند
It banishes fear with
the speed of a flame

5
00:00:27,785 --> 00:00:34,358
و همه ی مارا بخشی از جانبازی برای وطن می کند
And makes us all part of the patriot game

6
00:00:36,942 --> 00:00:43,942
نامم اوهانلون است 
بتازگی شانزده ساله شدم
My name is O’Hanlon,
I’ve just gone sixteen

7
00:00:44,692 --> 00:00:51,192
خانه ام در موناقان است
جایی در آن بزرگ شده ام
My home is in Monaghan
and where I was weaned

8
00:00:52,525 --> 00:00:59,525
در تمام زندگی لعنت کردنِ
انگلیس ستمگر را آموخته ام

I was taught all my life
cruel England to blame

9
00:01:00,292 --> 00:01:06,270
و حالا نقشی در این انقلاب دارم
And so I am a part  of the patriot game

10
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,983
به سختی دو سال شده 
Just barely two years since

11
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:16,208
از زمانی که با جنگی محلی 
I wandered away

12
00:01:17,108 --> 00:01:24,108
از ارتش (آزادی خواه ایرلند) دور شدم
With a local battalion of the bold IRA

13
00:01:24,858 --> 00:01:31,692
درباره قهرمانان وطن می‌خواندم و
 میخواستم مانند آنها باشم
I read of our heroes and wanted the same

14
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:39,317
تا نقشم را در این انقلاب ایفا کنم
to play out my part in the patriot game

15
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:47,490
آنها به من گفتند
چگونه کانلی کشته شد 
They told me how Connolly
was shot in the chair

16
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:55,170
از زخم هایش آشکارا خون می ریخت
His wounds from the battle
all bleeding and bare

17
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:03,330
آن قد و قامت رعنا در هم رفته بود و
مورد ضرب و شتم قرار گرفته بود
His fine body twisted,
all battered and lame

18
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:10,950

They soon made him part
of the patriot game.

19
00:02:11,186 --> 00:02:13,663

-The offensive against
Warrenpoint Harbour, they have

20
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,883
warned the owners of condo
ships using the port

21
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,973
that the safety of their vessels
can no longer be assured.

22
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,633
The harbour has come under motor gun
attack in part because Provisionals

23
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,216
say it’s being used by the army
and marines on intelligence gathering.

24
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,193
Train services between
County Down and Down Cork

25
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,743
have been disrupted
because of a bomb scare.

26
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:37,566
All the section of the lines and farms,
security forces are searching the area.

27
00:02:37,733 --> 00:02:39,853
-A soldier is still ill after being shot

28
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,853
inside the Royal Victoria
Hospital, in Belfast.

29
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,673
He was hit three times when
a gunman opened fire on him

30
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,753
in a corridor leading from
the casualty department to the canteen.

31
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,823
A policeman was also injured when gunmen

32
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,890
ambushed an ISE Landrover
on Springfield Road.

33
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:02,320
Several shots hit the vehicle and [?]

34
00:03:13,025 --> 00:03:17,850
-Belfast, North of Ireland,
a summer day like any other.

35
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:25,213
Since 1970, the days have been filled with
a war that has cost the British government

36
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:30,930
several hundreds of millions of pounds
and over 600 dead soldiers and police.

37
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,410
In the same time, over 2,000
Irish civilians have been killed.

38
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:43,930
All this is normally reported
in the news media like the sports scores;

39
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:49,466
Three Catholics killed, one Protestant
killed, two British soldiers killed.

40
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,152
Terrorists, Protestants, and Catholics
are the words one most often hears.

41
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,142
The image is a bit confused
but they stay nonetheless;

42
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,253
some kind of bizarre religious war.

43
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:10,633
And yet the two principal forces involved
in the fighting, the British Army

44
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,775
and the Irish Republican Army, have
nothing at all to do with religion.

45
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:23,108
[music]

46
00:04:27,442 --> 00:04:28,562
-Is that good?

47
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:03,973
-We cannot indeed afford to have
the country led by any other

48
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:09,853
policy other than a paramount
ideal of keeping indeed Northern

49
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,613
Ireland an integral part
of, the United Kingdom.

50
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,460
Otherwise, we perish.

51
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,613
As I have previously said, ladies
and gentlemen from this platform,

52
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:27,043
we the Unionist Party and indeed
the Orange Institution have nothing

53
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:31,816
to be apologetic for in the treatment
of the minority in this country.

54
00:05:31,983 --> 00:05:37,733
[chanting]

55
00:05:38,108 --> 00:05:42,150
-The city of Derry, October 5th, 1968.

56
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,650
The beginning of,
the civil rights movement.

57
00:05:46,817 --> 00:05:53,817
[crowd screaming]

58
00:06:27,733 --> 00:06:32,725
-These are images of one of the first
civil rights marches in Northern Ireland.

59
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:37,483
Civil rights, the name
and the tactics immediately

60
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:41,106
rocked the Southern United
States in the 1950s and ‘60s

61
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,233
in more ways than one,
as is plain to see.

62
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,600
A non-violent form of protest
for moderate reforms

63
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,880
which is met by systematic
police violence.

64
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,063
Only in this time and in this place
the protesters were White.

65
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:06,883
They were Irish. For most people
who know little about Ireland

66
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:09,703
and even less about
Northern Ireland, the events

67
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:14,203
of the late ‘60s are completely
baffling and with a good

68
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:18,180
reason, for Northern Ireland
is indeed a peculiar state.

69
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:24,210
For over 50 years, one political
party, the Unionists, were in power.

70
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,233
They had the support of Loyalists of all
social classes thanks to a political

71
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,723
line that was very simple, "Maintain
union with England and preserve

72
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:37,790
Loyalist supremacy, no
matter what the cost."

73
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:41,983
This meant control of all
the levels of government;

74
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:47,790
the police, the courts, housing, as well
as the major sources of employment.

75
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:52,723
In 1968, unemployment
in the Nationalist community

76
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:56,700
was nearly 25% compared
to 6% for the Loyalists.

77
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:01,050
Then there was a special powers act.

78
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:05,203
Over the years this law
has been used to imprison

79
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:09,270
thousands of Nationalists
without charges or trials.

80
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:18,000
To understand all this one must go back
in time to the roots of the trouble.

81
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:29,623
In 1601, English troops
led by Lord Mountjoy,

82
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:32,523
defeated the last
of the Irish chieftains.

83
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,883
Ireland, one of the richest
agricultural countries

84
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:40,698
in Europe was in the process
of becoming a British colony.

85
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,033
In the North of Ireland, where
resistance to the conquest had been

86
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,113
the strongest, large numbers
of Scottish settlers were given land

87
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,180
that had been forcibly
taken from the natives.

88
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,448
The colonizers happened to be Protestants,
displaced Irish happened to be Catholic.

89
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,600
That 17th-century settlement
explains why today in all of Ireland

90
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,680
there are one million Loyalists,
loyal to England that is,

91
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:13,620
to 3.5 million Irish Nationalists.

92
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,953
300 years later, the Loyalist
produced one of their most

93
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,200
charismatic and extreme leaders,
the Reverend, Ian Paisley.

94
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:39,913
In the late 60s, Paisley led a popular
Loyalist reaction against the civil

95
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,783
rights movement making it impossible
for the Unionist government,

96
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,983
to offer the Nationalists
even the slightest reforms.

97
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:54,150
[clapping]

98
00:09:54,733 --> 00:10:00,120
-I am giving a solemn declaration
to you that if there is an election

99
00:10:00,317 --> 00:10:05,040
-In the near future at Oxford,
whether in prison or out of prison,

100
00:10:05,275 --> 00:10:07,358
I’m going to fight on knees and hands.

101
00:10:07,525 --> 00:10:13,608
[cheers] [protestors chanting]

102
00:10:17,275 --> 00:10:20,275
-In the face of Paisley attacks,
the civil rights movement

103
00:10:20,442 --> 00:10:24,103
tried desperately to overcome
traditional sectarian divisions

104
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,603
between Loyalists and Nationalists.

105
00:10:26,775 --> 00:10:30,900
-Today when nearly two and a half
thousand people are unemployed.

106
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,543
-The theory was to ignore
the national question, the division

107
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:38,683
of Ireland, and instead just call
for social reforms that could

108
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:41,750
have benefited many
Loyalist workers as well.

109
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:47,036
The movement’s most eloquent leader
was a young student, Bernadette Devlin.

110
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:51,043
-Because if he stands up
on his two feet and he says, "Look,

111
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:55,303
I do 40 hours a week and you make
a great deal of profit

112
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:58,933
out of my labor and I am
entitled to a better

113
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,850
wage, it is a very simple,
very liberal demand.

114
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,570
I am entitled to more
money for the work I do."

115
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,050
Yet that person, if he make such
a demand, can be fired immediately

116
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:19,108
because there are two and a half
thousand people wanting that one job.

117
00:11:21,442 --> 00:11:23,893
-The civil rights movement
was not the first effort

118
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,650
to unite the two communities in Ireland.

119
00:11:26,817 --> 00:11:29,192
[music]

120
00:11:29,483 --> 00:11:33,973
-In the 1790s, the United Irish-Men
movement led by protestant

121
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:38,790
revolutionaries such a Henry Joy
McCracken, organized a major rebellion.

122
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:45,090
The movement which objected to trade
restrictions imposed by England

123
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,413
was strongly influenced by the American
and French revolutions and aimed

124
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,400
to establish an independent
Irish republic.

125
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:59,473
Although the leaders of the rising
were mainly protestant

126
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,648
and tried to recruit
settlers into the movement,

127
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:07,330
the settler community as a whole
stood loyal to the colonial government

128
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,784
and loyal it has remained throughout
every single rebellion in Irish history.

129
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:18,030
In the 1798 rebellion, 30,000
Nationalists were killed

130
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:21,858
and over 10,000 Loyalists
died fighting for the English.

131
00:12:22,025 --> 00:12:29,025
[music]

132
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,413
-I would lay a pound
to a penny that England,

133
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,490
like any other time is a slum landlord.

134
00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:01,303
I would lay a pound to a penny
that England, like any other time has got

135
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:06,608
a rich pasture of land that is
used solely for Yankees to play on.

136
00:13:07,275 --> 00:13:11,483
I would-- [cheers]

137
00:13:11,775 --> 00:13:16,333
-I would lay a pound to a penny that there
are quite a lot of families in Ireland

138
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:21,428
paying rent they can’t afford for property
they shouldn’t be asked to live in.

139
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:23,983
That there are people
in this town working

140
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:27,043
for wages they can’t
keep their family on from

141
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:32,066
men who don’t need half the money they’re
earning out of the work of Irish people.

142
00:13:32,233 --> 00:13:36,025
[cheers]

143
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:41,293
-The greatest help that you can
give the people in the North is

144
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:45,330
by showing the people
in the North that they’re not mad.

145
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,620
They’re not mad for believing.

146
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:51,443
They’re not mad for being idealist.

147
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:56,070
They’re not mad for thinking
that someday somehow

148
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:59,250
we are going to achieve
the workers’ republic.

149
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:06,030
Where o, where is our James Connolly?

150
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,100
Where o, where is that great gallant man?

151
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,317
He’s gone to organize the union

152
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:23,490
that working men they might yet be free.

153
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:31,063
And who, and who will lead the--
-In the early years of the 20th

154
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:35,850
century, Jim Larkin and James Connolly
organized the Irish working class

155
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:41,092
and linked it for the first time
to the long-standing republican movement.

156
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,353
This was a revolutionary
development and it led

157
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:48,420
to the most important of all
rebellions, the Easter Rising.

158
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:56,940
On April 24th, 1916, Connolly led
the Irish Republican Army, the IRA,

159
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,823
in an insurrection
in Dublin but the rebels,

160
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,743
besides being poorly organized,

161
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:07,710
had little popular support and within
a week the rebellion had been crushed.

162
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,413
Then the British government blundered.

163
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:17,353
16 rebel leaders, including
Connolly, were executed and thousands

164
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:21,104
of Nationalists were interned
in prison camps in England.

165
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:26,353
Almost overnight, the Irish people began
to give their active support to the IRA.

166
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:32,850
‘Twas better to die ‘neath an Irish
sky than at Suvla or Sud-El-Bar.

167
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:41,066
When from the plains of Royal Meath

168
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:44,280
strong men came hurrying through.

169
00:15:45,952 --> 00:15:50,066
While Brittania’s sons
with their long-range

170
00:15:50,233 --> 00:15:54,360
guns sailed in by the foggy dew.

171
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:00,941
‘Twas England bade our wild geese go,

172
00:16:01,108 --> 00:16:06,463
that small nations might be free Their

173
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:10,858
lonely graves are by Suvla’s waves

174
00:16:11,025 --> 00:16:14,880
on the fringe of the grey North Sea.

175
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:20,691
Oh, had they died by Pearse’s side

176
00:16:20,858 --> 00:16:25,483
or fought with Valera true

177
00:16:26,067 --> 00:16:30,650
Their graves we’d keep
where the Fenians sleep,

178
00:16:31,192 --> 00:16:36,650
‘neath the hills of the foggy dew.

179
00:16:37,192 --> 00:16:41,983
-By 1920, the IRA had developed
a highly successful campaign

180
00:16:42,483 --> 00:16:45,875
that was to become a model
of modern guerilla warfare.

181
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:50,593
Despite mass arrests,
Britain was unable to defeat

182
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,293
the Nationalists
militarily and the British

183
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:58,580
government was forced to concede a certain
measure of independence for the Irish.

184
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,523
At the same time, they readily
accepted the demands of the Loyalists

185
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:07,590
in the North, not to be included
in an independent Ireland.

186
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:13,483
Thus, a 26 county free state
was formed in the South while

187
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:17,426
6 counties in the North remained
under British jurisdiction.

188
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,703
The new state of Northern
Ireland was assured a majority

189
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:25,262
of 1 million Loyalists
to a half-million Nationalists.

190
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,413
The selected six counties
also happened to contain most

191
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:35,203
of Ireland’s industry but it was
only after a bitter civil war among

192
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:38,713
republicans before conservative
Nationalists, backed

193
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,592
by the British, were finally
able to impose the settlement.

194
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:46,483
It was in this way that British
economic interests were

195
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:50,940
protected, the IRA neutralized,
and Ireland was divided,

196
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:57,283
and for the next 50 years, the Unionists
in the North governed through

197
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:03,210
discrimination and Police terror
but the Loyalists were living in fear,

198
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,927
haunted by the specter of the IRA.

199
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:10,067
The patriot game was far from over.

200
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:17,464
[dramatic sound]

201
00:18:27,483 --> 00:18:32,900
-Derry city, the end
of the civil rights movement.

202
00:18:34,817 --> 00:18:41,358
[gunshots]

203
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,813
-Beginning August 12th, 1969,
the paramilitary Loyalist police

204
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:50,756
force attacked the Nationalist
ghettos in Derry and Belfast.

205
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:54,420
It was reaction in its purest form.

206
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,193
A violent effort
to return to a time before

207
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,827
the civil rights movement had existed

208
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,760
when Nationalists had been
passive and demoralized.

209
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:14,863
In Derry, barricades in Molotov cocktails
stopped the police, but in Belfast,

210
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:20,023
the ghettos are smaller and more isolated
and there the police were not stopped.

211
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:23,400
500 homes in Nationalist
districts were burnt down,

212
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,763
nine people killed and over
1,800 families fled South.

213
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:32,323
---property in the Belfast area
has been in the Catholic area but it is

214
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:35,967
the Catholic community which
has suffered most critical damage here.

215
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:37,816
-Well, this may well be.

216
00:19:37,983 --> 00:19:40,153
I’m not in a position
to say yet because quite

217
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,123
frankly, it hasn’t been
feasible for many people to go

218
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:46,033
into those areas as you know
and it will obviously

219
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,993
take a very long time to make
a count and assessment

220
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,983
of all the dreadful
things that have happened.

221
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:59,900
Walls of red-bricked
houses, solace, jarred,

222
00:20:00,067 --> 00:20:06,990
and burned Stand face
to face and back to back.

223
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:10,513
There is no lace curtains now.

224
00:20:12,983 --> 00:20:17,358
An echo from the distant past

225
00:20:17,525 --> 00:20:23,280
impervious to pain Cement

226
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,810
and bricks and human skill
will raise them up again.

227
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:37,650
From my flat above the streetside stir,

228
00:20:37,817 --> 00:20:40,980
I curse my newfound home.

229
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,733
No human skill will raise

230
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:51,180
my love to bloom into a man.

231
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:57,608
Shot by cowards in his bed

232
00:20:57,904 --> 00:21:01,761
at the tender age of nine.

233
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:10,090
Cry mother my child Patrick’s
dead in Belfast 69-- [clapping]

234
00:21:13,733 --> 00:21:19,063
-I understand today that they’re
bringing down their barricades in order

235
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:22,830
that the authority might
clean their streets for them.

236
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:28,710
Having littered and turned
the southside into a filthy place,

237
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:33,673
now they expect the municipal
authority or the commission

238
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,020
authority to do
their cleaning up for them.

239
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:41,160
Now, I want to say something
this afternoon and underline it,

240
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:48,180
that as far as I am concerned,
the protestant people have had enough

241
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:53,775
of this condoning of pulvering
and we say no to Rome.

242
00:21:53,942 --> 00:21:57,608
[crowd cheering]

243
00:22:08,567 --> 00:22:13,620
-On August 15th, 1969, British troops
began arriving in Northern Ireland,

244
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:18,464
with the announced aim of keeping
the peace between the two communities.

245
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,063
In reality, they were there to prop up

246
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:25,200
the state faced with
a virtual insurrection.

247
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:31,798
Civil Rights movement had
suddenly become irrelevant.

248
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:37,443
After August, it was
too late for reforms.

249
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:43,003
-Following the failure
of the 52-62 campaign, which

250
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:46,243
failed fundamentally because
it didn’t have the mass

251
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:50,570
support within the Nationalist
ghetto areas of the occupied North.

252
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:54,133
There was a reanalysis
and because of a certain amount

253
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,660
of demoralization which
resulted from that failure,

254
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,424
there was a reformist element which
gained control of the movement.

255
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:06,613
As a result, in 1969 when
the Nationalist ghetto areas

256
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:10,423
of the occupied North were
attacked by Loyalist extremists,

257
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:15,103
the Republican Army was not in a position
to defend the Nationalist people.

258
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:18,990
Initially, there was a sectarian
response to those attacks,

259
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:23,430
and the armed ability
of the Nationalist people was built up.

260
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:28,693
However, those people who had
initially formed the political core

261
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:35,250
of the Republican Army reanalyzing
that situation, that is the 1969 crisis,

262
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:38,473
realized that the sectarian element was

263
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,640
merely a symptom of British
imperialist rule.

264
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:47,400
Consequently, it was a necessity
to reanalyze a response to that symptom.

265
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:53,053
This led to the emergence of what
became known as a Provisional

266
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:56,683
IRA and the Provisional
IRA was to be distinguished

267
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:00,570
because it advocated
the necessity of an armed struggle

268
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,643
to be directed at the main
core of the problem,

269
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:07,543
which was British imperialism
and not a reformist approach

270
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:12,254
to sectarianism, which was merely
a symptom of British imperialist rule.

271
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,750
For us, this war is not just a war
of shooting British soldiers,

272
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:23,130
it is also about coming
to a final political objective,

273
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:29,100
which is the creation of a 32 county
Democratic Socialist Republic,

274
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:33,484
to be controlled by the ordinary
people for their own benefit.

275
00:24:34,358 --> 00:24:41,358
-Stand still, you’re under
arrest for breaking the-- [?]

276
00:24:42,358 --> 00:24:49,358
[background noise]

277
00:24:50,858 --> 00:24:55,723
-As I speak to you, the security
forces are very fully engaged

278
00:24:55,890 --> 00:25:01,230
in the task of dealing effectively
with the law-breakers in our community.

279
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:06,733
The army is holding an area
of the Lower Falls under

280
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:11,190
strict control of movement
for the rest of this weekend,

281
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:15,775
subject only to such relaxations as are

282
00:25:15,942 --> 00:25:19,260
necessary to prevent actual hardship

283
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:25,230
and to allow people tomorrow
to fulfill their religious obligations.

284
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:29,713
Details of these
controls, and of the areas

285
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,480
to which they apply have
already been announced.

286
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:40,213
We all regret, of course,
the inconvenience caused to decent

287
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:45,630
law-abiding people in this area
who constitute the great majority.

288
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:50,083
We are determined to rid
them and Northern Ireland

289
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:53,953
as a whole, of the terrorists
in their midst.

290
00:25:54,120 --> 00:26:00,403
-In the middle of 1970, following
a sectarian attack on one

291
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:05,040
of the Nationalist ghetto areas
in Belfast, the short strand area.

292
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:07,783
The Provisionals were in a position

293
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:10,890
to successfully defend
that particular ghetto,

294
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:15,572
where the Nationalist people were
outnumbered something like 10 to 1.

295
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:22,333
The following week, which was July 1970,
in a direct response to the ability

296
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:26,404
of the Republican Army to defend
the Nationalist ghetto areas,

297
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:31,838
the British Army occupied one major
Nationalist ghetto areas, the Lower Falls.

298
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:37,170
From the Provisional’s point
of view, this was full of indication

299
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:40,843
of why armed struggle was
necessary because this was

300
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:46,380
the first physical manifestation
of British imperialism since the 1920s.

301
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:51,463
For the first time, the people
could relate to the Provisionals’

302
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:56,520
claim that sectarianism was
in fact, just a symptom,

303
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,390
and that the main enemy was
British imperialism itself.

304
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,216
Here was something with
which they could identify.

305
00:27:08,858 --> 00:27:13,658
-I just turned down the corner of [?]
street about 20 past 12, Friday night.

306
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,603
Sunday morning, couldn’t
get home to my own home.

307
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:19,483
It was only around the corner
and what actually, seen a man

308
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:23,383
getting shot down, shot through
the head by the Scotch troops,

309
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,417
the corner of Coventry Road.

310
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:30,223
The young ones was about 30 minutes coming
and they had trouble getting their mom.

311
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:32,590
I think their mom has since died.

312
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:35,143
-Going to chapel
this morning, we were searched

313
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:39,330
for [?] and the on thing
[?] chapel this morning.

314
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:42,433
-It was like hell opening
for sinners at the [?]

315
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,233
it was worse than the battle at Mullins.

316
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,133
They were going at their houses
and racking their houses and all.

317
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:51,223
If you’d seen that montage you could
cry your eyes out looking at it.

318
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:53,443
-[?] at a quarter to six
my wife took birth.

319
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,610
She probably hit with teargas.

320
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,576
She was taken to Robert Tully
Hospital [?] Expecting a baby.

321
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,603
Baby was born a quarter
to three the next morning.

322
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:05,370
Baby still [?] was taken
at gunpoint from my house.

323
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:10,860
Yes, I was taken at gunpoint
over the Robert Tully Hospital.

324
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,943
Taken in to Robert Tully
Hospital to see my wife

325
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:15,733
and I was down there with
their guns on me at the corner.

326
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:19,303
At the very bedroom my wife was
laying and they had their guns on me.

327
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:21,703
They marched me like a trooper
down the street again.

328
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:22,843
Got me at the bottom
of the street and stood

329
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:24,073
me up against the wall and searched me.

330
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,253
They made me lay on my face,
and they took me around the house.

331
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:30,428
Now, I’m at my house
again. They racked my home.

332
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:35,623
I had just come around to the house
again, they just away, they racked home.

333
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:38,563
Dogs are had for our people,
they set them free.

334
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:42,122
Babies clothes, the meter,
beds, they tore them apart.

335
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,713
The food is scattered all
over the place searching for.

336
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,623
They went upstairs, bunk
beds took them down.

337
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:50,203
They took my wife’s bed down,
wardrobes took all that down.

338
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:52,183
They broke the windows in the back.

339
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:55,422
They’re animals, nothing
but short, just animals.

340
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,103
A scotch man, they were walking
down the street, they were

341
00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:00,870
walking by, got the wee
van outside the door [?].

342
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:04,525
They broke every window in the van
they said, "This’ll stop bullets."

343
00:29:04,692 --> 00:29:11,383
[?] we fix their 4,500 of them,
armed with tanks, machine

344
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:16,830
guns, the lot [?] They fixed
IRA 20 or 30 of men were guns.

345
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,883
They were tired of murder, which I have

346
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:21,850
murdered and which I’ll
continue to murder.

347
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:24,823
That’s the British army,
professional looters

348
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:26,983
professional robbers,
professional thieves.

349
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:34,150
[crowd yelling]

350
00:29:39,275 --> 00:29:42,223
-It was with the occupation
of the Falls Road that the Nationalist

351
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:46,294
population began to see the British
Army clearly as the enemy,

352
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:49,250
not as a neutral police force.

353
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:54,283
It was also the beginning
of what has since become

354
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:58,233
the longest war in the history
of English-Irish conflict.

355
00:30:01,067 --> 00:30:08,067
[shouting]

356
00:30:55,733 --> 00:31:00,650
[gun shots]

357
00:31:15,942 --> 00:31:18,673
-Shortly after the Falls Road
occupation, the guerrilla

358
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,690
war started, but it was
a new kind of war.

359
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:26,413
The IRA did not just ambush
British soldiers, they also

360
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:30,548
launched a bombing campaign
against British economic interests.

361
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:35,833
These actions have on occasion led
to terrible tragedy as with the Lamont

362
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,950
restaurant bombing of February 1978,
in which 14 people were killed.

363
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:45,313
Nonetheless, civilian casualties,
as a result of the Provisionals

364
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:49,453
guerrilla war have been relatively
low for the bombings are in fact,

365
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:52,153
systematically proceeded by a warning.

366
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:09,390
By August 1971, the number of monthly
bombings had risen to over 90.

367
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:20,503
The British government,
which directly reimburses

368
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:23,473
businesses for all war
damage that they suffer

369
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:28,120
was beginning to pay a very high
price for its Northern Irish coloring.

370
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,903
This single bombing of a Belfast
hotel caused no deaths

371
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:36,150
or injuries but it did cause
more than £2 million damage.

372
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:41,503
Against this guerilla campaign,
the British government hit back with

373
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:46,470
a measure that had always worked well
in the past, The Special Powers Act.

374
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,483
-They burst on the door
by counting on us to five.

375
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:53,113
They didn’t wait till we would
get up and answer the door.

376
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,693
They were in the bedroom
before we were dressed.

377
00:32:55,860 --> 00:33:00,275
They told my husband, "You’re getting
arrested down to the Special Powers Act."

378
00:33:00,442 --> 00:33:07,290
-It is with understandable reluctance
that one uses these exceptional powers.

379
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:12,853
This is not action taken against
any responsible and law-abiding section

380
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:18,540
of the community, nor is it in any way
punitive or indiscriminate,

381
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:23,503
its benefits should be felt,
not least in those places

382
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:27,480
where violent men have
exercised a certain sway

383
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:32,910
by threat and intimidation over
decent and responsible men and women.

384
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:38,623
The main target of the present
operation is the Irish Republican

385
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:43,566
Army, which has been responsible
for recent acts of terrorism.

386
00:33:43,733 --> 00:33:46,775
[gun shots]

387
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:52,920
-On August 9th, 1971, 350 Nationalists
were arrested in dawn raids.

388
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:58,900
In the rioting that day,
14 people were killed.

389
00:33:59,233 --> 00:34:06,233
[yelling]

390
00:34:28,317 --> 00:34:30,067
[gun shots]

391
00:34:34,275 --> 00:34:41,275
[music]

392
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:53,353
-The introduction of Internment
has given the [?] myself a chance to get

393
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:59,203
a grip of the gunman because our main
problem isn’t the local population,

394
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:02,983
it’s just the IRA gunmen
that we are interested in.

395
00:35:03,442 --> 00:35:10,442
[music]

396
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:23,370
Through the little streets
of Belfast In the dark of early morn

397
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:29,473
British soldiers came marauding
Wrecking little homes with scorn.

398
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:34,243
Heedless of the crying children
Dragging fathers from their beds Beating

399
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:38,634
sons while helpless mothers Watched
the blood flow from their heads

400
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:45,433
Armoured cars and tanks and guns
Came to take away our sons

401
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:51,358
But every man will stand
behind The Men Behind the Wire

402
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:58,873
Not for them a judge or jury Or indeed
a crime at all Being Irish means they’re

403
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:04,183
guilty So we’re guilty one and all
Round the world the truth will echo

404
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:09,733
CromweIl’s men are here again
England’s name again is sullied

405
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,733
In the eyes of honest men

406
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,650
-There was no man to [?]
These people have been

407
00:36:15,817 --> 00:36:21,233
sitting from half-past 4:00
on Monday morning till noon,

408
00:36:21,692 --> 00:36:24,425
and they’re still in the same conditions.

409
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,823
They’ve been put on their huts, as I say,

410
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:31,680
like a pigs, and the only
time they got out,

411
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:36,210
as for interrogation by the bastards
of the RUC special Branch.

412
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:40,873
As everybody well knows, when
they’re going for interrogation

413
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,393
with the special branch-- -Just
as Internment was introduced,

414
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,963
the Nationalists began to realize
that the internees had not only been

415
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:52,170
beaten up, which everyone expected
but that some had been severely tortured.

416
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:56,983
Electric shocks, druggings,
deprivation of sleep, food,

417
00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:01,170
water, all came under the official
term of interrogation.

418
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:06,283
In 1976, the European
commission of human rights found

419
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:10,226
the British government guilty
of torturing certain internee,

420
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:15,576
Britain promised such interrogation
methods would never again be used.

421
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:23,113
But in 1978, two different studies,
one by Amnesty International

422
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,863
and another by an independent
tribunal of jurist concluded

423
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:29,203
that brutality and torture
against Nationalist

424
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:32,037
suspects remained a widespread practice.

425
00:37:32,942 --> 00:37:36,973
-torture periods because I was
in Springfield road torture

426
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:40,753
center and I’d been held
for about three days at the time,

427
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:44,863
I had undergone the usual
torture treatment.

428
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:48,523
That is beating,
threats, the hot and cold

429
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:51,463
treatment, hot water,
and so on and so forth.

430
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:55,303
I was brought into a room where
special branch was there as they’d

431
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:58,693
torture us and they’d pull
the truncheon from the drawer,

432
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,963
and told me that the methods
of interrogation

433
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:05,138
could be two ways, the easy
way or the hard way.

434
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:07,770
I was very frightened.

435
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:15,090
I told him I wanted the easy way,
and he gave me a slip of paper and a pen

436
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:20,100
and told me that I was to give him
the names of two prominent IRA men,

437
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:25,200
two IRA volunteers officers.
I said I didn’t know any.

438
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:30,390
He left the room to get the heavy
squad, these are the gorillas,

439
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:33,158
absolutely, the big people,

440
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,293
and that if I hadn’t had
the names by the time

441
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:38,404
he returned, I could
expect the full treatment.

442
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:41,942
He went away. I was pissed of at this.

443
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:45,990
He came back, "Do you know any names?"

444
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:49,860
I said, "Well, I don’t
know anybody, but."

445
00:38:50,272 --> 00:38:51,775
When I said but, he jumped and he said,

446
00:38:51,942 --> 00:38:56,683
"Right, Mr. Austin, we know you’re
a very certain guy, you tell us

447
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:59,503
names and we let you go,
you go home to your family."

448
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:02,143
I said the names
and they were, Doherty O’conor

449
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:05,730
and Joe Cahill, whose names
were on TV every night.

450
00:39:06,108 --> 00:39:10,153
[?] dragged me from the room
back into the cell, but these

451
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,712
are one of the many, many,
many stories that happened.

452
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,143
This is the humorous
side of interrogation.

453
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:20,743
Now, the other side is the two
streets from here, last

454
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:25,290
week, a boy of 19 was arrested
and was beaten to death

455
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,413
by the special branch
and by the British soldiers.

456
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:33,853
This is a general practice, and they’re
beaten to death or near to death.

457
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,753
This is what is all about.

458
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:39,253
-I am an officer with the Northern
Ireland Prison Service .

459
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,353
Let me tell you about my job.

460
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:46,470
It’s about the variety, like
driving, using modern equipment,

461
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:50,610
escorting prisoners to court,
but mostly dealing with people.

462
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:53,383
I work with great mates
and I’m earning over

463
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:56,217
£80 a week, and that’s without overtime.

464
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,233
The prison service needs people.

465
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:03,703
People like you. Get the facts. Send
the coupon from a newspaper now.

466
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:07,573
-Since 1971, virtually every
adult in the Nationalist

467
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:11,324
ghettos had been arrested
and interrogated at least once.

468
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:18,373
In 1978, there were over 3,000 men
and women in prisons and prison

469
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:22,843
camps in Ireland and Britain,
the largest one being Long Kesh,

470
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:24,690
just outside of Belfast.

471
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:31,213
Through the years, Nationalist
prisoners have struggled

472
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:34,903
repeatedly using hunger
strikes, prison insurrections,

473
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:39,210
and escapes in order to assert
their rights as prisoners of war,

474
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,823
rights which were recognized

475
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:46,230
by the British government
before March 1976

476
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:52,275
but which have since been denied to all
Nationalists arrested after that date.

477
00:40:52,442 --> 00:40:59,442
[music].

478
00:41:04,025 --> 00:41:09,403
-When Internment was introduced
in 1971, there was a spontaneous

479
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:13,033
reaction by the Nationalist
people to this particular

480
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,343
repressive measure which allowed

481
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:18,450
the Republican Army
to re-accelerate its war.

482
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:23,250
The main emphasis within that war
was an economic bombing strategy.

483
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:28,560
The whole emphasis of the armed
struggle was a destabilization program

484
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:34,230
to prevent politics as it had manifested
itself within the occupied North,

485
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:39,120
from stabilizing itself and consolidating
some sort of base for itself.

486
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:44,563
Then, because most of the political
parties were already backed

487
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:49,620
by commercial interests, the best
way of obtaining that destabilization

488
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,453
was with an economic bombing strategy.

489
00:41:55,942 --> 00:41:59,067
[bombs going off]

490
00:42:35,733 --> 00:42:40,933
-It’s very difficult to suggest
any particular security

491
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,813
action that can avoid this kind of thing.

492
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:46,753
This particular devastation
apparently was caused

493
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,310
by a lorry hijacked
in Joy Street yesterday.

494
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:54,600
Now, there must be some
people who saw the hijackers.

495
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:59,300
There must be some people who know
who’s involved in this bombing.

496
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:04,680
I doubt very much whether there are
very many people organizing this.

497
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:08,773
I doubt whether there are very
many people taking part in this,

498
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:13,033
but it is high time that every
citizen of Northern Ireland,

499
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:17,053
quite irrespective
of religion, quite irrespective

500
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:22,020
of politics, came forward
and said, "I have information."

501
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,443
That, in my view, is
the only adequate means

502
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:29,210
of dealing with this sort of situation.

503
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:45,233
[bombs going off]

504
00:43:54,442 --> 00:43:57,308
-How about SDLP, how
do you feel about them?

505
00:43:58,692 --> 00:44:02,316
[crosstalking]

506
00:44:02,483 --> 00:44:07,441
-Is there anybody in this part of Belfast
that you place your confidence in?

507
00:44:07,608 --> 00:44:08,816
-Yes, the police.

508
00:44:08,983 --> 00:44:12,775
[laughter]

509
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:15,823
-As the war accelerated after Internment,

510
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:19,153
the Nationalist not only
rejected government authority,

511
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:24,248
but also the moderate Nationalist parties
who still hoped to reform the state.

512
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:28,003
Bypassing the politicians,
they began to deal

513
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:31,306
directly with the problems
faced by the community.

514
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:36,763
This meant building parks and daycare
centers for children as well as meeting

515
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:42,114
places for the elderly in areas which had
never had the slightest social services.

516
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:45,973
Neighborhood People’s
Assemblies were formed to solve

517
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:49,530
housing, unemployment,
and other day-to-day problems.

518
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:54,583
All this activity culminated
with the formation of entire

519
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:59,490
self-governing areas that became
known as Free Derry and Free Belfast.

520
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:04,183
The large Nationalist
community in Derry refused

521
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:07,550
to pay rents and taxes
to the Unionists government.

522
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:10,483
The police and the army
were kept out of the area

523
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:13,260
by barricades openly manned by the IRA.

524
00:45:14,763 --> 00:45:18,067
In effect, Derry had seceded
from Northern Ireland.

525
00:45:18,442 --> 00:45:25,442
[music]

526
00:46:26,233 --> 00:46:30,643
-On October 11th, 1969, there were
riots in the Loyalist districts

527
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:35,910
of Belfast, so the city government
took the public buses off the road.

528
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:41,923
Three days later, they were rolling
again in Loyalist areas, but it was

529
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:46,634
three months before bus service was
restored to the Nationalist ghettos.

530
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:51,883
Forced back upon their own resources,
some enterprising local people

531
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:55,954
went over to England and began
bringing back secondhand taxis.

532
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:02,192
This was the beginning of the Falls
Taxi Association, the people’s taxis.

533
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:09,650
[background conversations]

534
00:47:10,733 --> 00:47:14,829
---for the taxis, I don’t think
any of us would have gone to work

535
00:47:15,108 --> 00:47:17,953
because there’s no buses on the road,
took large buses off the road,

536
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:19,573
the Whiterock Road buses off the road.

537
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:22,693
It’s about two miles to walk
down to the Whiterock

538
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:25,941
Road so you would be late
for work-- [crosstalk]

539
00:47:26,108 --> 00:47:32,650
-[?]

540
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:43,700
-The taxi rate are very obliged.

541
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:49,993
-We could point out that the Falls
Taxi Association is now among

542
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:54,450
the biggest self-help organization
in the north of Ireland.

543
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:57,442
We now have 350 drivers,

544
00:47:57,775 --> 00:48:02,083
450 persons, self-employed actually

545
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:05,514
working on the routes
that we have specified before.

546
00:48:07,110 --> 00:48:12,013
The media treat us very unkindly
with the fact that in Newry

547
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:18,570
for instance, the second-highest
unemployed town in the north of Ireland,

548
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:25,813
where the minister of commerce got
seven minutes on the national news

549
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:31,920
and the national press to the effect
that he had created 15 jobs.

550
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:36,150
He stated at that it costs
£17,000 to create

551
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:39,163
a job for one person in Northern Ireland,

552
00:48:39,330 --> 00:48:43,963
yet we have never received any credibility
or acknowledgment from any source

553
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:46,150
to the fact that we have created

554
00:48:46,317 --> 00:48:51,283
350 permanent jobs for people that,

555
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:53,983
because of the areas where
they live, the Nationalist

556
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:57,360
ghettos, they can’t find
employment anywhere else.

557
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,400
They have to remain in the areas.

558
00:48:59,567 --> 00:49:01,303
-This is the lower part of the Falls now

559
00:49:01,470 --> 00:49:04,303
are coming down under
the area of Whiterock.

560
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:09,253
This is the general route when you’re
coming down under the center of the town.

561
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:12,620
As I say, we come down
to this bottom of this road,

562
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,243
there’s quite heavy bit of traffic on it,

563
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:18,853
but at one time we used to have
to go through these areas when

564
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:22,860
there was riots, bombings
and hijacking of buses and whatnot.

565
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:26,953
The whole thing about it was,
not during one of those times did

566
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:32,220
any of our taxis ever stop or fail
to run a service in these areas.

567
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:36,854
This is why the public has shown
concern to use the taxis

568
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:41,441
because their point of view was
that we have gotten them to work.

569
00:49:41,608 --> 00:49:42,493
We’re dependable.

570
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:47,040
We’re a far more efficient service
and quicker, and we are cheap.

571
00:49:47,970 --> 00:49:50,837
This is why they depend
on us at the moment.

572
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:53,443
They’re now pushing the [?]
of the Whiterock which at one time

573
00:49:53,610 --> 00:49:57,973
was a tremendous for riding
and hijacked buses at that time

574
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:01,003
during confrontations
with the security forces.

575
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:04,063
One example, during internment
day, there was quite a few people

576
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:08,520
shot up around this area, and still
even then, the taxis still ran.

577
00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:10,753
This is the lower floors
end of it where most

578
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:14,173
of the raiding and burning had
taken place, and as I said,

579
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:17,713
during those times when the taxis
was traveling through it, the raiders

580
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:20,353
were courteous enough to stop
throwing for that few seconds,

581
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,723
and to let us through, so as to get

582
00:50:22,890 --> 00:50:25,273
to the safety of their own
people back home.

583
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,923
Coming up to the place,
and I recall there was

584
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:31,093
a blast, and this is where
a lot of the RUC had turned

585
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:36,103
their guns on innocent people
at that time so they did.

586
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:40,153
As I said, the taxis didn’t bar, they just
kept on running in and out the stage.

587
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:43,933
They took various in-routes,
as long as they got the people home.

588
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:48,673
They went over barricades and everything
so they did, and this was the whole point.

589
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,833
The taxis never did stop running.

590
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,776
I think this was a thorn
on the side of the security forces.

591
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:59,173
-Harassment of the taxis,
it’s a general thing.

592
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:03,493
If you look behind us now,
this is a normal procedure where

593
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:08,503
they threw up roadblocks, stopped
motorists, especially taxis,

594
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:13,213
and took the driving license
of the driver, and make them

595
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:16,963
sit for anything up to 30
minutes, search the vehicle,

596
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:20,266
make the passengers stand
on the side of the road.

597
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:26,323
Sometimes they attempt to arrest
the drivers for unknown reasons, most

598
00:51:26,490 --> 00:51:30,763
of the drivers are well-known on the road,
they’re on it seven days a week.

599
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:35,833
We have to react when they do
arrest a driver, and our alternative

600
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,973
and the only weapon that we have
is to set up our own roadblocks.

601
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:45,343
What we would do, seal
off the vehicle that would be trying

602
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:49,723
to arrest the driver, put taxis
at the front, to the side,

603
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:52,023
and the back it and hand him on.

604
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:56,070
Generally, that works,
and they release the driver.

605
00:51:56,910 --> 00:52:01,873
If they do arrest the driver and take
him away, what we normally do then

606
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:06,013
would be block off the main arteries
into the city, when we do this,

607
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:09,700
we can close the entire city
within a matter of minutes.

608
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:13,063
We only need to close off three
roads, and that brings

609
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:17,190
a complete standstill
to the entire city center.

610
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:20,263
Generally, this serves the purpose,

611
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:23,438
and the driver is released
after a short period.

612
00:52:27,858 --> 00:52:32,893
-In 1971, nationalist civilians
became increasingly the random targets

613
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:37,440
of a campaign of no-warning bombs,
kidnappings, and assassinations.

614
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:45,060
In other words, death squads.
It was a loyalist reaction.

615
00:52:57,390 --> 00:53:01,998
The British army paid scant attention
to the loyalist kind of militaries.

616
00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:06,883
Their major concern was in dealing
with the new wave of mass

617
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:10,954
demonstrations by nationalists,
protesting against internment.

618
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:16,903
The streets of Northern Ireland
soon became a real-life laboratory

619
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:21,230
for the army’s experiments
in controlling an insurgent population,

620
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:26,678
and the nationalists were
the human guinea pigs.

621
00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:34,453
One of the techniques was the use
of so-called harmless weapons, including

622
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:40,050
the not-so harmless CS gas, which
was first widely used in Vietnam.

623
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:46,333
CS gas is in fact, lethal, and can cause

624
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:49,680
permanent damage to the lungs,
stomach, and eyes.

625
00:53:56,490 --> 00:54:00,120
The gas, the water cannons,
the burning of matches,

626
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:03,402
the mass arrests, all had
little apparent effect.

627
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:08,184
Week after week, large demonstrations
were held against internment.

628
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:13,543
Finally, in Derry, on January
30th, 1972, the British

629
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:18,210
army decided to use a more
effective technique, live arms.

630
00:55:04,525 --> 00:55:11,150
[sound  of distress]

631
00:55:11,317 --> 00:55:14,608
[background noise]

632
00:55:14,775 --> 00:55:21,775
[somber music]

633
00:55:48,817 --> 00:55:53,413
-[?] one soldier come, got
out before they even stopped

634
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:56,563
the sirens and tanks got
on his knee and shot everywhere,

635
00:55:56,730 --> 00:56:00,523
and about seconds after soldiers
followed him doing the same thing.

636
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,953
We heard them from
that flat there calling,

637
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:05,113
"Don’t stop shooting,
shoot the Irish bastards."

638
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,333
Lieutenant-Colonel Derek Wilford:

639
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,403
I say again, that I hesitate
to call anyone

640
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:12,900
liers, but the facts are,
we were fired at first,

641
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:16,303
and we retaliated in the only
way which was possible to us.

642
00:56:16,470 --> 00:56:18,703
-No weapon, they had no stone,
they had nothing, they was

643
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:22,573
just standing, and as we turned,
they started firing.

644
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:24,275
Well, we heard the shots.

645
00:56:24,442 --> 00:56:27,358
We heard a few shots,
and as we turned, he fell dead.

646
00:56:27,525 --> 00:56:30,643
-He went to tell the soldiers
to stop firing, you can see

647
00:56:30,810 --> 00:56:34,394
the blood running there, where
the gentleman was shot at.

648
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:38,643
That’s all I can tell, I was too shocked.

649
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:44,833
-I never saw it, even on the worst
film I ever looked at, that was

650
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:49,590
massacre, it was mass murder,
and I don’t care who hears me say it.

651
00:56:51,390 --> 00:56:54,403
I never hope to live
to see the day that will

652
00:56:54,570 --> 00:56:58,363
ever happen again, where
it’s pure murder. Murder.

653
00:56:58,530 --> 00:57:01,003
-The day they come in shooting,
there was no doubt about it.

654
00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:04,033
From their commander box, they were
shooting even before the commander

655
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:07,912
box said, and there wasn’t
a nail bomb thrown in this area.

656
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,693
No, there wasn’t a rifle shot fired.

657
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:12,493
They were the people who
had done the shooting,

658
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:15,103
and then the police bagged
them up from the wild fear.

659
00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:17,820
The police, they shot dead more of us.

660
00:57:18,090 --> 00:57:19,483
That’s what caused
that lad’s death there.

661
00:57:19,650 --> 00:57:21,523
He tried to help two
other lads, and they were

662
00:57:21,690 --> 00:57:23,083
shot down, just like a bloody dog.

663
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:25,243
Just like animals, we were shot at.

664
00:57:25,410 --> 00:57:29,340
I have no doubt this has been planned.

665
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:32,503
They called off the arranged
meeting, and the place they had

666
00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:35,233
the meeting, and the girl talks
to us so they could shoot us.

667
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:38,923
They didn’t care who we were, didn’t
care, man, woman, or child here.

668
00:57:39,090 --> 00:57:40,483
A youngster died this morning
where they were run

669
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:43,978
over by [?] then went back
over the top of her again.

670
00:57:44,567 --> 00:57:49,111
What are we going to do? Are we going
to stand by idly and watch it all?

671
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:58,650
[somber music]

672
00:58:29,442 --> 00:58:31,813
-Following Bloody Sunday,
there was a tremendous

673
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:35,180
upsurge of nationalists
feeling throughout Ireland.

674
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:39,973
Large demonstrations were held
north, and south, and in Dublin,

675
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:43,770
a 30,000 strong crowd burnt
down the British Embassy.

676
00:58:44,790 --> 00:58:46,303
For the first time, the nationalists’

677
00:58:46,470 --> 00:58:49,933
resistance had assumed threatening
proportions in the South

678
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:53,428
where Britain still had
important economic interests.

679
00:58:54,810 --> 00:58:59,290
The British government had little
choice but to make major concessions.

680
00:58:59,490 --> 00:59:04,273
On March 24th, 1972, the union’s
government was suspended

681
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:08,088
by London, and Britain promised
to release the internment.

682
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:13,933
That Easter, as the nationalists
in Derry, held their annual commemoration

683
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:19,153
of the 1916 rising, the resistance
movement was apparently in its

684
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:22,220
strongest position since
the start of the war.

685
00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:25,350
-[?] of their destiny.

686
00:59:26,070 --> 00:59:33,043
On one hand, if we’re determined,
if we are courageous, if we are

687
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:37,110
resonant, and if we are
strong-willed enough to recognize

688
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:40,950
that compromise will not
solve our country’s problems.

689
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:46,050
If we recognize that compromise
never achieved anything,

690
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:49,483
and that compromise never
will achieve anything,

691
00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:54,450
and that therefore our fight must
continue, and that we will win that fight,

692
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:56,833
then we are truly following

693
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,383
in the footsteps
of the men, and the women,

694
00:59:59,550 --> 01:00:02,450
and the and the boys
and girls of Easter Week.

695
01:00:03,525 --> 01:00:10,108
[applause]

696
01:00:14,733 --> 01:00:20,443
-Suspending operations at Christmas
and at Easter and in implementing

697
01:00:20,610 --> 01:00:26,220
a three-day unilateral truce
on March 10th, 11th, and 12th last.

698
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:34,303
In addition, we have held
wide-ranging talks with various groups

699
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:38,880
and parties with a view to holding
an all-Irish conference.

700
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:43,400
Would you pass them down, please?

701
01:00:43,567 --> 01:00:46,733
-Yes. Isn’t it politically really
difficult, if not impossible,

702
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:51,073
for Mr. Whitelaw to do as you suggest
in view of the high emotion that’s been

703
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:55,693
engendered amongst Protestants,
particularly with the forthcoming weekend?

704
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:57,993
-My reply to that would be this.

705
01:00:58,483 --> 01:01:01,333
If Mr. Whitelaw and his government
are sincerely interested

706
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:05,340
in peace, then he’d be prepared
to discuss our terms with us.

707
01:01:06,108 --> 01:01:12,403
-We were anxious to discuss
our proposals with the representatives

708
01:01:12,570 --> 01:01:16,723
of the British government but we were
determined that if there was going

709
01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:19,213
to be a truce, it was going
to be a bilateral truce.

710
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:23,863
It was going to be that would be
publicly recognized by the British

711
01:01:24,030 --> 01:01:26,803
and that would be conditions
that would be binding on the British

712
01:01:26,970 --> 01:01:30,433
army as well as on the Republican
army, and this was done.

713
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:34,900
Then we went to London
and we met Mr. Whitelaw

714
01:01:35,067 --> 01:01:38,983
and members of his political
staff, and we listened

715
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:42,373
to what he had to say, which
didn’t amount to very much.

716
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:46,530
Then we presented our own
document, our own proposals,

717
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:50,203
and which we called upon
the British government

718
01:01:50,370 --> 01:01:54,163
to recognize the right
of the Irish people as a whole,

719
01:01:54,330 --> 01:01:57,914
acting as a single unit,
to decide the future of Ireland.

720
01:01:58,710 --> 01:02:00,673
We called upon the British government

721
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:04,890
to withdraw all their forces
by a specified date.

722
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:08,803
Mr. Whitelaw didn’t
turn down our proposals.

723
01:02:08,970 --> 01:02:13,123
He said he would refer them
back to his cabinet, and this is

724
01:02:13,290 --> 01:02:18,763
what I believe brought about
the ending of the truce.

725
01:02:18,930 --> 01:02:22,783
That Mr. Whitelaw went back to Ted
Heath who was Prime Minister

726
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:27,060
at the time, showed him
our document, our proposals.

727
01:02:27,570 --> 01:02:30,433
Ted Heath read them and turned
around and said, "Well,

728
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:33,608
I don’t think there’s
anything can be done here.

729
01:02:33,930 --> 01:02:36,913
You’d better break the truce
as soon as you can."

730
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:41,490
In fact, the truce broke
on the following Sunday night.

731
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:45,613
It nearly broke that morning
in Portadown over the severe

732
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:50,460
provocation, and it broke
on that Sunday night.

733
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:55,633
It was inevitable and in view
of the behavior of the British

734
01:02:55,800 --> 01:03:00,510
troops in Lenadoon in Belfast
that the truce was going to break.

735
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:04,440
It broke with tragic results
for everybody concerned.

736
01:03:05,070 --> 01:03:08,383
Tragic results for the Irish
people, for the English people.

737
01:03:08,550 --> 01:03:13,363
Tragic results for the British
troops and the IRA volunteers

738
01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:16,273
and the civilians who have
been killed since then.

739
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:22,860
I hope that the day will come, again,
when British representatives realize that

740
01:03:25,170 --> 01:03:28,693
the only way to a permanent
peace in Ireland is

741
01:03:28,860 --> 01:03:31,513
to meed to representatives
of the Republican movement

742
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:34,691
and negotiate with them
a phased and orderly withdrawal.

743
01:03:34,858 --> 01:03:36,525
[background noise]

744
01:03:36,692 --> 01:03:39,403
-Two days after the peace
talks in London, the truce

745
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:42,770
broke down in a Lenadoon
housing estate of Belfast.

746
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:47,743
There, 16 displaced nationalist
families had been allocated homes

747
01:03:47,910 --> 01:03:50,043
by the Public Housing Authority,

748
01:03:50,490 --> 01:03:53,290
but the homes bordered
a loyalist district,

749
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:56,743
and the Ulster Defence
Association, the largest

750
01:03:56,910 --> 01:04:00,780
of several loyalist paramilitary
groups, opposed the move.

751
01:04:02,010 --> 01:04:03,943
In turn, the British army refused

752
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:06,910
to permit the families
to enter the houses.

753
01:04:07,590 --> 01:04:12,134
In the confrontation that day
in Lenadoon, six civilians were shot dead.

754
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:17,566
In the next week, 13 British
soldiers were killed.

755
01:04:19,173 --> 01:04:22,949
It was the end of a truce which
had lasted barely two weeks.

756
01:04:31,317 --> 01:04:38,317
[explosions]

757
01:04:47,317 --> 01:04:54,317
[music]

758
01:05:19,426 --> 01:05:22,567
[explosion]

759
01:05:31,275 --> 01:05:38,275
[screaming]

760
01:06:01,170 --> 01:06:03,763
Following the breakdown
of the truce, the Provisionals

761
01:06:03,930 --> 01:06:07,066
launched their biggest
military offensive to date.

762
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:10,573
The commercial centers of Derry,
Belfast and other major

763
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:14,580
towns began to look as if they had
been blitzed from the air.

764
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:18,673
In the space of a few days,
British investment was hit

765
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:22,993
with millions of pounds of losses,
and because of warnings,

766
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:26,923
there were virtually no
civilian casualties, until July

767
01:06:27,090 --> 01:06:31,560
21st when bombs placed
in Belfast killed nine civilians.

768
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:36,463
The British government and media
seized the opportunity given by Bloody

769
01:06:36,630 --> 01:06:42,060
Friday as it was to be called,
to present the IRA as mad terrorists.

770
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:46,903
It was only several months later
that an investigation by the London

771
01:06:47,070 --> 01:06:51,043
Sunday Times revealed that hour-long
warnings for all the bombs

772
01:06:51,210 --> 01:06:54,110
had been given
to the Samaritan organization,

773
01:06:54,450 --> 01:06:57,117
which had, in turn, notified the police.

774
01:06:57,330 --> 01:07:00,133
For some reason, however,
several of the bomb alerts

775
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:03,628
were not passed on by the police
to the target areas.

776
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:07,333
The result was several innocent
people were killed and injured

777
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:11,468
and a tremendous propaganda
victory for the British government.

778
01:07:11,650 --> 01:07:14,108
[explosions]

779
01:07:28,858 --> 01:07:31,723
-A lot of people assume
that this distortion was

780
01:07:31,890 --> 01:07:35,154
bad journalism when, in fact,
that was not accurate,

781
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:38,293
for this distortion was
a deliberate tactic within

782
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:42,120
the context of Frank Kitson’s
theory of counterinsurgency

783
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:45,913
because Kitson has recognized
the important role

784
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:49,770
that the media has to play
in a counterinsurgency campaign

785
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:53,623
and has always strived to use
the media as a platform

786
01:07:53,790 --> 01:07:57,013
where necessary to distort
the image of the Republican Army

787
01:07:57,180 --> 01:08:00,553
as a liberation movement
and to project this image

788
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:05,070
of the British occupation forces
as some kind of police service.

789
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:20,743
-10 days after Bloody Friday,
22,000 British troops occupied

790
01:08:20,910 --> 01:08:25,650
the nationalist ghettos in a move
code-named Operation Motorman.

791
01:08:27,630 --> 01:08:30,530
It was the end of free
Derry and free Belfast.

792
01:08:31,775 --> 01:08:34,723
-Let Ireland see, there’s
the power. There’s the power there.

793
01:08:34,890 --> 01:08:35,683
-That’s the power of the [crosstalk]

794
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:37,963
-You can’t disobey
against a man like that.

795
01:08:38,130 --> 01:08:41,550
-The cream of the British
Army and paratroopers.

796
01:08:42,750 --> 01:08:46,453
A couple of thousand go over them house
last night and cut off their limbs.

797
01:08:46,620 --> 01:08:47,441
They didn’t give us a chance.

798
01:08:47,608 --> 01:08:48,525
-They’ve taken over [crosstalk]

799
01:08:48,692 --> 01:08:50,358
-Arrange a meeting with Jack [?] and-

800
01:08:50,525 --> 01:08:51,441
-It’s a blarney.

801
01:08:51,608 --> 01:08:52,941
-It’s a lot of bloody hooey.

802
01:08:53,108 --> 01:08:53,858
-Yankee blarney.

803
01:08:54,025 --> 01:08:57,073
-We are damned up here. We are
getting murdered up here. Murdered.

804
01:08:57,240 --> 01:09:00,883
-I have made it perfectly clear that these
operations are designed to protect

805
01:09:01,050 --> 01:09:06,043
the whole community, to remove
the fear of intimidation by terrorists

806
01:09:06,210 --> 01:09:08,773
from the community, from
whatever it may come.

807
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:13,033
I think that after the work
of Her Majesty’s government over

808
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:16,183
these recent months, the patience
of Her Majesty’s government,

809
01:09:16,350 --> 01:09:18,823
the work to convince
the minority community

810
01:09:18,990 --> 01:09:21,043
that we are determined
to give them a fair deal.

811
01:09:21,210 --> 01:09:24,883
I trust this friction will not
arise. I see no reason why it should.

812
01:09:25,050 --> 01:09:28,890
The security forces are there
to protect the whole community.

813
01:09:33,150 --> 01:09:34,963
-There are over 1,000 different British

814
01:09:35,130 --> 01:09:38,010
firms throughout Ireland,
North, and South,

815
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:43,470
controlling more than 60% of the country’s
total industrial activity.

816
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:54,566
One week after Operation
Motorman, moderate nationalist

817
01:09:54,733 --> 01:09:57,997
politicians were having
talks with William Whitelaw.

818
01:09:58,710 --> 01:10:01,843
In order to pacify the nationalists,
the British government

819
01:10:02,010 --> 01:10:05,274
was willing to force
concessions from the unionists.

820
01:10:06,450 --> 01:10:11,220
Finally, in January 1974,
a power-sharing government was formed

821
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:16,708
in which moderate nationalists were
given certain cabinet positions.

822
01:10:17,550 --> 01:10:20,640
It was at Northern Ireland
first, also a last.

823
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:26,923
The problem was that after 300 years
of ascendancy, the loyalist people

824
01:10:27,090 --> 01:10:31,506
would only support a government
that could guarantee their privileges.

825
01:10:32,899 --> 01:10:36,163
Power-sharing with
the nationalists was unthinkable.

826
01:10:38,910 --> 01:10:44,413
On May 14, 1974, loyalist extremist
groups controlling workers in the key

827
01:10:44,580 --> 01:10:49,124
electric generating plants launched
a strike against the new government.

828
01:10:50,610 --> 01:10:52,783
When the British Army
refused to intervene,

829
01:10:52,950 --> 01:10:55,483
the success of the strike was assured.

830
01:10:56,490 --> 01:10:59,754
Within two weeks,
the power-sharing government fell.

831
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:03,673
Britain had been caught
in a contradiction of trying

832
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:06,784
to reform a state that was
simply irreformable.

833
01:11:08,490 --> 01:11:10,783
It could only be
consolidated by the physical

834
01:11:10,950 --> 01:11:13,550
crushing of the nationalist resistance.

835
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:17,803
The other solution, the only
possible one for the nationalists

836
01:11:17,970 --> 01:11:21,874
remained the destruction
of the Northern Ireland state itself.

837
01:11:22,350 --> 01:11:26,126
The struggle in the north had
passed the point of no return.

838
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:31,860
-We have decided to protest
against internment.

839
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:35,923
Despite the ban on parade,
we have decided that we will

840
01:11:36,090 --> 01:11:38,990
parade tomorrow through
the streets of Derry.

841
01:11:40,317 --> 01:11:47,317
[crowd singing]

842
01:11:57,483 --> 01:12:04,483
[background noise]

843
01:12:16,567 --> 01:12:23,567
[music]

844
01:14:01,817 --> 01:14:05,400
-This is Turf Lodge, a housing
estate in West Belfast.

845
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:11,263
It’s a nationalist
district like most others

846
01:14:11,430 --> 01:14:14,108
which means an unemployment
rate of over 20%.

847
01:14:14,275 --> 01:14:17,066
[parade music]

848
01:14:17,233 --> 01:14:20,443
-It also means a military
occupation, endless raids

849
01:14:20,610 --> 01:14:23,900
and arrests, and the constant
threat of violent death.

850
01:14:24,067 --> 01:14:31,067
[parade music continues]

851
01:14:40,358 --> 01:14:44,503
-On October 4th, 1976,
12-year-old Brian Stewart

852
01:14:44,670 --> 01:14:47,473
of Turf Lodge was playing
in front of his home

853
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:52,056
when he was killed by a plastic
bullet fired by a British foot patrol.

854
01:14:53,310 --> 01:14:55,723
At the time, there was
no rioting or gun battles

855
01:14:55,890 --> 01:14:59,538
in the area which made the killing
all the more senseless.

856
01:15:00,990 --> 01:15:04,753
Since then, the women of Turf Lodge
have gone out into the streets each

857
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:09,272
and every day to protest against
the continued British army presence.

858
01:15:12,509 --> 01:15:19,509
[whistles]

859
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:26,900
[background noise]

860
01:16:10,233 --> 01:16:11,863
-Turf Lodge really started it and all

861
01:16:12,030 --> 01:16:14,113
the women come out with
their [?] whistles.

862
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:17,293
Now, three or four months later, all

863
01:16:17,460 --> 01:16:22,333
the nicest areas in [?]
Murphy are going [?]

864
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:25,033
they’re nearly all out with
their [?] whistles again.

865
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:28,650
The women are starting to show the lead.

866
01:16:29,250 --> 01:16:33,510
They recognize the need for them
to work on the par with the man.

867
01:16:34,470 --> 01:16:39,210
From the start, women have been
involved in the military campaign

868
01:16:39,510 --> 01:16:43,723
but now, the woman who usually
stayed at home are all coming

869
01:16:43,890 --> 01:16:46,303
out and begin to feel
the power that they have

870
01:16:46,470 --> 01:16:48,583
when they’re all bonded
together and coming out

871
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:52,142
as a force and making
their presence felt in the area.

872
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:55,180
The Brits obviously
don’t like this at all.

873
01:16:56,430 --> 01:16:58,393
If there’s only one
or two women, they think

874
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:01,003
they can abuse them
but before they know it,

875
01:17:01,170 --> 01:17:05,970
there’s hundreds out and the Brits are
chased out of this particular area.

876
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:09,193
Last week at the elections,
you remember they had

877
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:12,330
the elections and we had
a picket outside.

878
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:15,133
We were telling the people,
"Why are you going to vote?

879
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:16,873
You’re going to vote
for British imperialism?

880
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:19,525
You’ve had it for 100 years,
and what has it achieved?

881
01:17:19,692 --> 01:17:20,941
[background noise]

882
01:17:21,108 --> 01:17:24,275
[gunshots]

883
01:17:24,442 --> 01:17:29,442
[shouting]

884
01:18:11,942 --> 01:18:14,593
-In August 1976, in the midst

885
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:17,293
of the continuing war,
a peace movement was

886
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:21,876
formed which tried to regroup moderate
nationalist and loyalist women.

887
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:25,273
For the first time in a long
time, Northern Ireland

888
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:28,307
became front-page news
throughout the world.

889
01:18:29,010 --> 01:18:31,843
The peace movement was
significant as a truly remarkable

890
01:18:32,010 --> 01:18:36,330
media event which, however,
never quite took root in reality.

891
01:18:38,608 --> 01:18:42,943
-[?] the formation after
three children had been

892
01:18:43,110 --> 01:18:46,470
killed in an accident
on the Upper Falls Road.

893
01:18:46,830 --> 01:18:49,663
What has happened was
that an IRA act of service

894
01:18:49,830 --> 01:18:52,920
unit organized to ambush
the British Army.

895
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:59,190
On the way to the ambush, they were
chased by a British patrol.

896
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:02,803
The patrol opened fire
on the car. The driver was killed.

897
01:19:02,970 --> 01:19:07,066
The car obviously went out of control
and hit the three children.

898
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:12,330
At the beginning of that, there was
obvious sympathies towards the family.

899
01:19:13,530 --> 01:19:15,133
People were very sympathetic.

900
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:17,173
People were very sorry what had happened.

901
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:23,263
The peace movement led by [?]
a local pro-British journalist, used

902
01:19:23,430 --> 01:19:27,974
this opportunity to launch a movement
that was directed against the IRA.

903
01:19:29,310 --> 01:19:35,025
From it’s [?] formation, it condemned IRA

904
01:19:35,192 --> 01:19:37,843
violence but didn’t condemn
British army violence.

905
01:19:38,010 --> 01:19:41,203
It condemned the shooting
of businessmen but allowed

906
01:19:41,370 --> 01:19:44,237
the shooting of innocent
Catholic civilians.

907
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:48,930
It progressed solely because
it was well-financed.

908
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,443
We believe that it’s financed
solely by the British

909
01:19:53,610 --> 01:19:57,660
government and by pro-British
elements and by big business.

910
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:05,040
It continued to about January
of this year, fairly strong.

911
01:20:05,970 --> 01:20:10,723
What happened then was in the West
Belfast area, the British

912
01:20:10,890 --> 01:20:14,263
army deliberately sent
in the paratroop regiment who

913
01:20:14,430 --> 01:20:16,633
as you can remember were
responsible for the massacres

914
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:19,363
in Derry, the shooting of Majella O’Hare,

915
01:20:19,530 --> 01:20:21,793
the schoolgirl who was
murdered by the British army,

916
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:25,200
and other mysterious
shootings in the country areas

917
01:20:25,380 --> 01:20:27,583
the British army were directly
responsible for those.

918
01:20:27,750 --> 01:20:32,880
The paratroop regiment came in typical
SAS fighting, house raiding,

919
01:20:33,210 --> 01:20:38,593
abuse, beating people up, in-depth
interrogation, and in actual fact,

920
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:41,623
they threw a young boy out
of a window at the interrogation

921
01:20:41,790 --> 01:20:44,863
center that I mentioned earlier
on, Springfield Barracks.

922
01:20:45,030 --> 01:20:48,553
This, a fact of life, alienated
the people even more from

923
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:51,673
the British army, and the Republican
Movement were seen

924
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:56,730
to be the only ones who cared
and who could provide the alternative

925
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,810
to this type of attitude
that the British army had adopted.

926
01:21:00,990 --> 01:21:05,533
Also this campaign of harassment
by the British paratroop regiment.

927
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:09,463
The Peace Movement issued no
statements, didn’t condemn the violence,

928
01:21:09,630 --> 01:21:13,483
and in fact, issued statements saying
that they support law and order

929
01:21:13,650 --> 01:21:16,786
and that we nationalist
people should do the same.

930
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:18,905
The problem was how can you support law

931
01:21:19,072 --> 01:21:22,108
and order when law and order is kicking
your door in and beating you up?

932
01:21:22,275 --> 01:21:26,634
[background noise]

933
01:21:27,650 --> 01:21:30,983
[screaming and shouting]

934
01:22:01,067 --> 01:22:05,483
Here, take him away.

935
01:22:05,650 --> 01:22:10,692
[?]

936
01:22:56,141 --> 01:23:03,141
We'll arrest you as well.
We're going that side.

937
01:23:03,767 --> 01:23:10,767
[?]

938
01:23:47,150 --> 01:23:50,025
Can you come up [?]?

939
01:23:50,192 --> 01:23:57,192
-[?] You're on TV.

940
01:24:01,585 --> 01:24:06,358
-He's well [?] his family [?]

941
01:24:06,858 --> 01:24:13,858
-Tell me about [?] [crosstalk]

942
01:24:18,900 --> 01:24:22,358
-He'll hardly [?]

943

945
01:26:58,275 --> 01:27:05,275
[applause]

946
01:27:05,692 --> 01:27:12,317
[?] appreciate it, [?].

947
01:27:12,817 --> 01:27:14,650
They [?], didn't they?

948
01:27:15,608 --> 01:27:17,608
Wiped your [?] away.

949
01:27:17,858 --> 01:27:24,858

[gunshots]

952
01:30:19,108 --> 01:30:24,650
-[?]

953
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:28,733
As you know this camp officially
starts, when you're on this camp,

954
01:30:28,900 --> 01:30:32,863
do not leave the room, and you’re
not to move without permission.

955
01:30:33,030 --> 01:30:36,553
When you are on the camp, you’ll
use numbers instead of your name.

956
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:40,093
There’ll be numbers from one
to three, besides, there’s

957
01:30:40,260 --> 01:30:43,716
a guard who’ll have to stay
in the camp 24 hours a day.

958
01:30:44,490 --> 01:30:48,013
I’m the TO. I’ll be teaching
in the weapons, and you’re not to handle

959
01:30:48,180 --> 01:30:51,252
a weapon until I tell you,
or you ask permission.

960
01:30:51,608 --> 01:30:57,442
Well, [?].

961
01:30:57,858 --> 01:31:00,720
All right this is the AR-15.

962
01:31:01,590 --> 01:31:03,853
The first thing you do, when
you take possession of any weapons,

963
01:31:04,020 --> 01:31:08,244
you check it for safe, if there’s
a magazine on it, you release it.

964
01:31:10,518 --> 01:31:15,817
To check the page by touch,
and by site on possible,

965
01:31:16,332 --> 01:31:20,721
check the safe, for the [?] cork.

966
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:24,763
Always point the weapon
in a safe direction.

967
01:31:24,930 --> 01:31:28,002
Never take anyone’s word
that the weapon is safe.

968
01:31:28,380 --> 01:31:31,633
Right now, I’ll name the parts
there on the top, there

969
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:35,384
on the right, there on the left,
and there on the bottom.

970
01:31:35,650 --> 01:31:39,490
-The Republicans quite clearly
have outlined their proposals,

971
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:44,340
for the future riot that’s
called earner of the new Ireland.

972
01:31:44,820 --> 01:31:50,293
In New Ireland, we invented
self-governed communities, that is

973
01:31:50,460 --> 01:31:53,473
the people on the grind, will
have a say in their lives,

974
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:56,503
will have a say in how
their area is run, and will have

975
01:31:56,670 --> 01:32:00,702
the dignity that the workers have
lacked for so long in Ireland.

976
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:06,073
Those community clusters will be
affiliated to a regional council who

977
01:32:06,240 --> 01:32:10,912
in turn will be under direction of what’s
known as the provincial council.

978
01:32:11,190 --> 01:32:14,413
Ireland is divided
in four equal provinces,

979
01:32:14,580 --> 01:32:16,633
they have Ulster, Munster,
Leinster, and Connaught.

980
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:20,563
These councils at every step will
take into consideration the voices

981
01:32:20,730 --> 01:32:24,553
of the people from the ground,
to the provincial governments,

982
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:28,944
who intern will be affiliated
to the federal parliament of Ireland.

983
01:32:29,250 --> 01:32:30,943
This is a solution
to the problem of Ireland.

984
01:32:31,110 --> 01:32:35,833
The solution is not to get rid
of the Brits, and exchange one master

985
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:40,483
for another master, the Irish capitalist,
the solution is to give the control,

986
01:32:40,650 --> 01:32:42,823
and the wealth of Ireland
to the people of Ireland,

987
01:32:42,990 --> 01:32:47,100
and allow them to administrate
what they need for themselves.

988
01:32:48,180 --> 01:32:51,973
The point that I made earlier on about
the peace people, or so-called people.

989
01:32:52,140 --> 01:32:54,750
They are actively working against us.

990
01:32:55,290 --> 01:32:59,910
They have said that what
we need is more bureaucracy,

991
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:04,333
and we need to have more
civil servants ruin our lives.

992
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:07,603
We quite simply said
the solution to Ireland is

993
01:33:07,770 --> 01:33:10,933
the people, the Irish people
who can provide a solution,

994
01:33:11,100 --> 01:33:16,900
and that solution will be found only
under a socialist system, and that’s it.

1000
01:35:27,692 --> 01:35:34,692
This Ireland of ours
has for long been half free

1001
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:42,400
Six counties are under
John Bull’s tyranny

1002
01:35:43,108 --> 01:35:49,817
And still, the Valley is greatly to blame

1003
01:35:50,858 --> 01:35:57,525
For shirking his part in the patriot game

1004
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:06,483
I don’t mind a bit if I shoot down police

1005
01:36:07,650 --> 01:36:14,483
Their luck is for long
Never guardians of peace

1006
01:36:15,450 --> 01:36:22,450
But yet as deserters I’m never letting

1007
01:36:23,188 --> 01:36:29,817
those rebels who sold
out the patriot game

1008
01:36:32,251 --> 01:36:39,233
Now I am dying, my body all holes

1009
01:36:40,020 --> 01:36:47,020
I think of those traitors
who bargained and sold

1010
01:36:47,746 --> 01:36:54,483
I’m sorry my rifle has not done the same

1011
01:36:55,442 --> 01:37:01,470
For the Quislings who
sold out the patriot game
